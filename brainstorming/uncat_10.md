I focus on writing the most intense scenes first on a rough timeline, then figure out how to put them together later

Edited

there's going to be a cover up about the ghosts being used for assassinations for years, but Clayton only thought they were accidents

he didn't know they were intentionally being used to kill people

then you have an ex viatech security engineer

it was her job to try and gain access to a ghost and control it remotely

to find technical vulnerabilities

turns out she quit when she found a backdoor in the system

and they were unwilling to fix it or there was somehow someone above them preventing them from doing so

but even after quitting, she still has the backdoor, which she plans to use to her advantage when she gets the chance

as her and Dex escape out of the city somewhere where they can't be found

she explains to Dex how the backdoor works, as they prepare to turn on a phone to upload evidence of the assassinations to Clayton's "Zap" account using the phone they got off of his dead body

they are able to break into the phone using a literal wax figure of clayton's face, that the ex eng had made years ago

precisely for when she had the chance to do this

as the footage is uploading, red headlights fill the blinds of their cabin

one of them shouts, "run!"

and then the vehicle rams straight through the wall and glass and into the warehouse they were hiding out in

turns out it's an aivia mammoth

it crashes into a center pillar right and detonates

but right before it does, it pins the ex engineer to the pillar, basically cuts her in half

they have a few moments to share words, ex eng tells dex he needs to finish the plan

then she dies in his arms

the mammoth was hauling a huge fuel tank, which is spilling gasoline on the ground

which is getting closer to the fire

so Dex has to run for his life to get out of the warehouse

before it goes off in a massive explosion

and as he's running with the woods with the phone trying to stall for time while the files upload

we see a ghost arrive at the burning warehouse

and it dismounts 4 Boston Dynamic's dogs with spotlights

which start hunting down clayton through the woods

I've been unable to figure out how the fuck Dex gets out of THAT

but in the end he ends up charging the secret headquarters of the top dog in an old pickup truck

covered in wrong way signs to fuck up the aivia's self driving

as he draws into the complex grounds, he gets swarmed by literally hundreds of ghost but they all drive off course when they get close him and all explode in a ball of fury

causing like a river of explosions to engulf him as he charges head first towards the one aivia that isn't flying off course

its headlights and LEDs are red instead of blue

and as it gets closer, a hatch opens up that reveals a 50 cal gatling gun

and then you have a gatling gun car chase

Edited

eventually he outmaneuvers the car and it goes up in flames but his car tumbles as well and he gets trapped in the wreckage

at this point the garage opens up and the main guy drives out in an uncontrolled ghost

and the bad guy starts talking to Dex over the loudspeaker

explaining how everything he's done is pointless

and his death will mean nothing

and nothing will stop them

then he trips the switch that controls the gatling gun hatch

and starts firing it

and as he's turning the vehicle to hit Dex

suddenly it goes red

Dex used the backdoor the ex eng showed him

and Dex just drives him off a fucking cliff

then there's the falling action

where the big scheme is busted and to address the crisis, Dex just drives all of the ghosts in the country into bodies of water, to destroy the technology

cue sunsets, people wrapping their arms around each others backs

and a nice voice over monologue

probably Dex reading the last words that of the engineer or clayton

I haven't decided, because I don't want to redeem Clayton in the audience's eyes

but it gives a look into his mind that the audience wouldn't otherwise get

something like this

The Self-Driving Machine: A Tale of Ambition and Consequences

and when Dex is done reading it, he's standing over Clayton's grave

he pauses after reading it, holds it down, and looks at the grave

"that's a crock of shit, coming from you"

and as he turns his back and walks away from his grave

we see a headstone that says

CLAYTON STANFORD VISIONARY

and then it cuts to black
