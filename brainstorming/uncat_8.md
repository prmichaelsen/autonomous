int day - clayton's office

the blinds are shut

silence pierces the stiff air

Clayton is the first to speak

"Well?"

"Sir, this is... this is just impossible.. this couldn't happen"

"Evidentially it is possible, Dex."

"A man is splattered on the pavement and headlines are splattered across every major news site on the planet!"

he pauses

yelling, " international!"

"this is international news! do you know what this does to our image?? our success??"

"i don't--"

"you're lucky you didn't kill a customer! FAITH is the key component of our business. TRUST and SAFETY."

"it only works if people BELIEVE it is safe"

"I--"

"you're LUCKY the man who died was a nobody. no will will miss him. no lawsuits from a grieving family ."

but we're still going to have the DOJ up our ass, the FCC, the DOT, all are going to be coming for blood, you understand? to shut this company down. Everything that I have built, everything I have done, could go down in flames! my blood! my sweat! my credibility. my entire life.

"speak."

I will look into it, sir. But I'm telling you, this couldn't have been our tech. I'm certain. Maybe if something in QC went wrong--that's the only failure point, QC. human error. a machine did not make this mistake on its own. the tech is safe

// listen

"you're at my mercy right now. i could have you disappear for this.// you have no idea who I know.// by not killing you right now, im showing you mercy. i am showing out my grace"

"are you grateful for my grace"

"sir, I--

slamming the desk and shouting at full volume, almost shrieking, almost like a frightened child, a tantrum. more begging than anything

"TELL ME, YOU ARE GRATEFUL FOR MY MERCY"

"I'm grateful..."

"for?"

"your mercy.."

"the man who died... who was he?"

"no one. which is who you will be if you do not give me answers: how did this happen?"

"It can't. We have 10 million miles driven with no incident, testing is sound, QA left nothing unturned, every edge case, every crash scenario, we simulated everything . Our sensors have 99.9 repeating to the 20th decimal place precision. I can tell you it was not a computer vision issue. this was not an issue with the technology, something happened here.

"// But it's not 100%,""

"Obviously there was an edge case, Dex"

99.9 whatever percent is not 100

"That's how you failed"

// "Sir, I would never say anything is 100%.

This technology has always had a non-zero chance of failure, however small, that non-zero chance is always there. Never have I reported this technology as 100% safe. I want that to be clear. but 99.9 repeating to the 20th decimal place is as good as 100%, six sigma is the standard, that's 99.99966 but if you map our data on a bell curve that includes our success cases the sigma value is theoretically infinite

"there's a non zero chance you will spend the rest of your life in a federal prison, Dex."

// what's the sigma on that

"if you're lucky" // maybe cu

"how would you map that on a bell curve?"

deep breath

// listen

// i want us to take a clearer view of the situation. you need to think about this objectively. im emotional, you're emotional, this is not a time to be emotional. it's time to account, for all the possible ways this scenario could play out

// "sir, there's no legal precedent for this. it could be a fine, they could go after the engineering team, they might go after the one who signed off, sir."

"If you have any ounce of self preservation Dex, you'll find out what went wrong, and who is responsible. Right now it's on your head unless you can prove that it's not your fault. When they subpoena the company, you're the one who will be answering questions, not me"

I'm the face of this company, I'm the visionary behind this company, I'm an advocate for the future of humanity, but engineering? that's on you

this company can survive without you, it wouldn't exist without me

someone needs to be the face of this failure

and if you don't give me a definitive answer of who or what was responsible in the next 48 hours, then it's going to be you
