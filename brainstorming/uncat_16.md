political thriller 

fiction (autonomous film)


could maybe shoehorn this in between the office scene and the death scene


maybe there's a protest outside the office and he arrives 


he goes in through the back 


when i run for tempe city council again my campaign slogan will be

"i don't know what i'm doing but i'm pretty sure i can do a better job than those guys"


i think we should drag the rich from their houses, into the street, and beat them to death with baseball bats


but, we're civilized people, so i'm resolved to mend our differences amicably 


---


some people call my politics radical 


but are they really? we're facing extraordinary times 


we have a nation in decay, a working class pinned between rising cost of living and intentionally depressed wages 


meanwhile an unprecedented amount of wealth has been allowed to be hoarded by a viscous, microscopic fraction of humanity


a kind of person who would rather sacrifice the well being of the entire planet 


than take one less private jet flight 


// "that fantasizes about self driving cars

while they drive humanity off a cliff"


what's radical about wanting to see this person come to justice? what's radical about asking to see haliburton and black water war criminals tried for their war crimes?

our struggle



---


how do we solve this other than ripping these bastards from their homes and crushing their skulls between the pistons of their very own machines?


that's a good question. i'm glad you asked. because i think we would all prefer a diplomatic solution before it comes to that.


but clearly you are aware it will come to that. otherwise why are you stocking up on autonomous police bots, riot gear, military grade weaponry and vehicles? are you so convicted in your vile ways that you would rather wage an all out class war than concede some basic human dignities to your loyal subjects?


why are you buying private islands and building larger gates? why are you building rockets to escape the earth? are you so fixed on your greed you would forsake the very planet itself?


these are questions i ask our ruling class to think gravely upon. for if i am not mistaken of the passions of the people, you will very soon have a demand for elected leaders like myself, who will speak candidly on the subject, and who are very aware of the value of violence in checking unchecked tyranny.


i, like all americans, value the wisdom of our founding fathers--the framers of our constitution. it always occurs to me this quote from thomas jefferson, of which i think justly applies to today's political climate and global climate crisis: 


"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."


    Thomas Jefferson

It is illegal to announce treason or incite others to violence, and I will state clearly // plainly // that this is neither. This is a warning to you who are failing to hear the voices of unrest. You are going to be the subject of their justice when they seek it. It would be prudent to consider reforming your image, or at the very least, hearing their voices before they become violent.
