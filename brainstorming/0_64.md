The camera cuts back to the scene of the accident.

Sirens are flashing, casting shadows and blue and red silhouetttes of the figures standing over the body of the man before him.

He chokes, gurgles blood, holding onto his last breaths.

His last words to the bystander who rushed to him first:

“Stop… Viatech… Stop… Aivia”

The life finally leaves his eyes

as the camera pans out from the scene.

The vehicle that hit him is revealed.

Decals on the car are clearly visible.

Dented, and rich with blood.

AIVIA GHOST

reads the decals.

beneath the words, read a slogan:

“The future drives itself”

The shot pans outward to a birds eye view

CUT TO:

INT. MID-DAY - Viatech Headquarters
