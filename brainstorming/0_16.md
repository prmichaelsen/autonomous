you'd be forgiven for mistaking him as a beggar

one of those "crazy" characters

one that simply wanted to warn of an impending doom

he could have been any raving lunatic standing at the corner with a cardboard sign

spelling out conspiracies

plots by the CIA

or claims the FBI tapped his phone

but cardboard signs were no use for him

he only had a message for one man

outside a busy complex nestled within the city, he waited, for as long as possible, and as close as possible, every day by the head quarter office of the man who owned the company Aivia:

Clayton Stanford

for the chance that Clayton would one day walk
out of that building...

and he could deliver his message...

dreamed or imagined...

but as real as ever to the mind

a matter of life

and death

a secret that may save many lives if shared

but endanger one

Clayton Stanford's fate hung in the balance of a beggar

a man he wouldn't look in the eyes

but would look in Clayton's

and tell him what no one else ever would:

The Truth
