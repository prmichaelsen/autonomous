a machine that can use logical reasoning is deadly

the AI of our era--generative AI--learning languages models--was of a simpler breed.

the machines gave the illusion of thought

but were incapable of reasoning

only the generation of information based on reasonable inferences about complex linear regression models which weighted the variables necessary to produce output that appears to be intelligent thought

but generative AI does not rely on facts. generative AI will invent things that don't exist, as long as they seem in line what it understands things in general to be

if you ask it about a technology that doesn't exist, it will supply you tutorials on how to use it as though it already did

but logical reasoning is based on truth. facts. there is no shadow of a doubt what a machine says is true when a machine can logically reason. there's no playful inventions.

logical languages.

i had been trained to write in logical languages

i wrote many queries in logical languages

what i didn't realize

is that what i was doing

was teaching machines to think

// for themselves
