Well you’re off the grid now, buddy. No one’s finding us here.

They will… they’ll find us. Viatech will find us. They can find anyone.

Tell me something, fella, why do they want to find you?

Because I have information…

Same. I know the truth. They don’t want me to tell the truth, that’s why they’re tracking me. That’s why I’m out here.

Yes, ok, then you have to help me… help me expose them.

Char3 stands up quietly, slowly, begins to undo his restraints.

“They’ve been trying to usurp my birthright. They don’t want to believe it, but this world is a false reality.”

“In the city, it’s where it all started, where Lucifer fell. They tried to elocrute me. But I won’t let them usurp my birthright. They send radio signals to intercept my frequencies”

Whispering in char1’s ear: You know the truth, don’t you? The truth beyond the veil?

…char3 undoes his last restraint.

char3 sits back in his chair. staring at char1 quietly, examining him.

Your journey led you here. I heard the call from the woods, I found you. You’re here to help me expose the truth. Pierce the veil.

“Yes…” sighs a breath of cautious relief, “Yes… pierce the veil”

Char3 nods approvingly.

“Do you have a computer?”, says Char1

“Do I look like I own a computer?”

…

“Do you have a vehicle?”

“Truck”

“What year?”

“97”

“Can you get me to a computer?”

// “And let them electrocute me?” // “And let them usurp my birthright?”

“Right… right because of the frequencies”

“They’ll electrocute me. They send radio signals to intercept my frequencies”

“What’s your name?”

“You don’t need to know my name.”

“Right… I’m going to reach in my pocket”

“I’ll reach in your pocket”

“Ok, reach in my right pocket”

Char3 removes the external hard drive.

Char3’s eyes narrow as he examines the device. He looks at char1 with suspicion “What’s this?”

“It’s a device that blocks the frequencies. That’s how we… get into town… it protects you”

CUT TO

birds eye view, headlights of a truck driving down a forest road

they pull onto an interstate

“How far to the next town?”

“14 hours”

—

Cut to protests, ghosts being used to control protests

—

Dawn

they pull into the town of calva

population 15

all that’s there is pretty much a forest ranger station and a post office

“Do you have a computer?”

“You look like you need an ambulance”

“Do you have internet?”

“Sure do” // “I have dialup”

CUT TO

*dialup tones whirring*

“Takes a second”

Looking out window. There are barriers that say road closed and “Wrong Way"

“I have an idea”

“Forget the dialup, let me borrow your phone”

…dials Varick

— // intense conversation, char1 reveals he is heading to the headquarters

CUT TO all vehicles departing from the protest, heading towards the headquarters

CUT TO

Driving into the city with road signs affixed to all sides of the truck

// // the XCU low angle of the roadway with the truck approaching

// // as it approaches the camera, we see “ROAD CLOSED”, “WRONG WAY” affixed to the grill

// driving into the city

they approach the city

CUT TO

the vehicles have all formed rank to protect the headquarters

they surveil the outside area

suddenly, truck comes hurling out of the forest, directly towards the HQ

ghosts began swarming the truck

as they approach, they suddenly swerve out of control

// “Are you prepared to walk your path? To pierce the veil”

// “No one is ever ready. But it’s my path.” // “This is my trial. It’s my duty to save the world, break down this false reality."

Varick, frustrated, recognizes that the solution is working. The vehicles are programmed for
emergency incident response first—self preservation. It can’t be overrided.

Varick orders his engineers to find a way to reverse the self preservation.

Varick decides to manually hop into a vehicle, turn off self driving mode, to hunt Varick down

As ghosts crash by the dozens, Varick’s vehicle heads into the fray—one distinction, as Varick’s vehicle
approaches, it’s revealed his is equipped with a 50 cal automatic machine gun.

Explosions and an intense chase ensue.

Eventually, the machines correct their issue with the road signs, and begin to hunt effectively

They corner the truck against the wall, in rank. Varick’s vehicle pulls forward. He then fires
the 50 cal into the truck until the truck is all but decimated

(the vehicles could swarm in a circle, creating an impassable field of high speed vehicles)

He approaches, the vehicle, fire behind him, red glow and headlights.

// villain monolouge (I hope youre alive in there) yadda yadda

Once he arrives at the driver seat to check he is dead, it’s not Char1 at all.

// runs simultaneously with the below

Char4 (engineer) watches onscreen

suddenly there’s a gun to his head

Char1 - “Cooperate, and you’ll live”

—

Suddenly, BWUUUUUUUM

Varick’s car pulses, it’s red LED lights begin to glow

It’s now being remote controlled.

Varick sees this and darts behind the truck, but it’s too late

The vehicle pelts Varick’s cover, panning side to side to ensure complete destruction

The truck is torn to pieces

it explodes

Varick is no more

—

Meanwhile…

the data upload to the social network is complete

The engineer forces all the vehicles to crash themselves into the fire and the building

// all other ghosts around the city begin to crash themselves

Forming a spectatular scene of destruction

Finally, character lights the building aflame

// “Give me your phone”
// might be funny if he calls an uber to the hospital

Epilogue? 

News stories?

Protests outside viatech?

—

Outside the flaming building

// //  Are you going to kill me? 
// // No, I promised

// What will you do now?
// Go off grid, I suppose

// // // // It’s over. I stopped it.
// // // // No, you slowed it down. 

“What do you expect now? Something will change?” 

// // // My lifes work. Gone.
// // //  It’s how it should be. Maybe engineer overpowers char1 and shoots him 
// // “Technology will never stop evolving. You can’t stop progress. The age of autonoma is here”
// People have short memories. The media won’t report this. Autonomous vehicles are inevitable. Prices must be paid."

“It has to. This data is now in the hands of the world. The world will react accordingly”

“Do you really believe that?”

“I have to”

CUT TO BLACK

// maybe the crazy guy can deliver the data?
