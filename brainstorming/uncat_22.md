the truth about where--


the truth about where your company's money comes from

during stock holder v clayton scene 


2024


the truth about where


what's that?


the truth about where. the truth about where the company's funding comes from 


// what the matter clayton? you look like you just found out santa's not real // 


// how old were you when you figured out santa claus wasn't real? //  


// the funding is military 


// uh, yup. 


// that's right clayton. 


what did you think all these government subsidies were? a climate project? this is the real world clayton. 


// // don't use uh yup, delete that's right clayton. 


you've created an unprecedented opportunity 


opportunity? these, these vehicles they're meant to to save lives not take them! 


they're they're they're meant to improve the world not destroy it!


clayton, radar was a military project, the internet was a military project... major advancements are funded _for war_.  // defence? // _because of_ war. you had to have known that this technology would be used this way eventually. 


// in what way?


// // you said it yourself 

// instead, maybe: 

    oh clayton, do i have to spell it out for you?
    you don't live up to your last name, do you?
    you're not very bright 


// // destroy lives // or just go to 1024


Goto 1024


4096



reprehensible.


now theres a way to talk. don't forget it's your invention that's been doing the killing. and it's been you doing the cover ups. you were even present for one of the accidents, i recall? i read all the reports. and we have the onboard footage. 


you're blackmailing me?


// no, i'm telling you the facts 

no, i'm doing you a favor. look the other way. you've never had a problem with that before. 


...


clayton


don't do anything rash 


// ...


// despite what everyone tells you, you're not very bright 


// i can only protect you so much

he can get his assistant to bring him an older model which doesn't have the self driving mode 


ext office day 


ok, maybe he drives his own vehicle, aka one without autonomous driving (an older model)


however, those still have break and acceleration assist which is enough to get the job done


lampshade with "clayton doesn't use the autonomous vehicles, he doesn't trust them"


"you mean he says it's safe for the rest of us, but he won't use them himself?"


"yep"


---


clayton takes a deep breath. he turns on the vehicle, navigates to "self driving: off" and "data: off" 


he starts driving, then begins to dial main characters number 


meanwhile main character has been tracking him


we see just the car side of the phone call


clayton begins spilling what he's learned in an uncontrolled rant 


at a light, midsentence, his car suddenly lurches into an oncoming pickup truck 


the team then notices the watch pulse disappear


even better, because he's an idiot, he'll just use the autonomous ones but turn off self driving and data and think he's safe 


----



he can share his location 


---


david


what?


look at this 


oh man


his watch biometrics... there's no pulse 


oh my god 


// do you think he took it off?


// ok, so let's say they're tracking him using a stolen device that's hooked up to icloud and they're using find my to track him via his watch 


they see the gps data moving, suddenly stop, and then no vitals on the watch 


---


1024


// the accidents 


all this time i thought they were anomalies, edge cases, external attacks, but... // those weren't hacks // it was you. how is this possible? how could... how could...


// but.. those weren't hacks, were they?


oh, clayton, do you even know how your own invention works? 


my engineers assured me--


--they told you what your security clearance granted you, no more


MY security clearance? I would think I would know if one of my engineers had a higher security clearance than me. everything // in this company // goes through me! 


// you look 5' 11, do you put 6 foot in your tinder bio?


// these are my inventions! for the good of mankind!


// you didn't invent them. and even if you did, you don't own them // you don't get to control them // just because you invented them // you didn't pay for them // the military paid for them // the military did // you can't control what they're used for  // the military owns them 


// let me spell this out for you: you wanted to put autonomous death machines on every road in the united states, did you really think that wasn't a national security concern? 


you think i wanted to put autonomous death machines on every road in the united states?!!


maybe not. but that's what you did. 


long pause. clayton looks like he's seen a ghost. then to himself, quietly 


goto 4096


--- 


// need to add some lampshading:

    explain why clayton would bring a green subsidy issue to this character
    explain why character would assume this is about embezzlement 


0.0


i've been going over finances recently 


have you?


yes, one of my subordinates directed my attention to a a curious, what appears to be a discrepancy in the green subsidies filing


the green subsidies filing, huh? let me get ahead of you on this one clayton. if you're worried about embezzlement


no no that's not the case at all, besides i have plenty of money, // and // i wouldn't want to accuse a shareholder of embezzlement 


// original lines, maybe cut this entire block 

then where is this going?

// that's an odd choice of words

// i wasn't under the impression you were doing that. 

// i wasn't under the impression you were // accusing me of anything //, but now i feel  obligated to ask: where exactly is this going?


// i wasn't under the impression that you were accusing me of embezzlement // 1st choice 

// i wasn't under the impression that you were // 2nd choice 

// that's not the impression you were giving me

// is that what you're doing? 


// im not 

// // use above 


// then where is this going?


it's just, well we traced some of the funding from how it was earmarked by the federal government and how it reached our cash reserves 


ok


and you see, not all of it is from funding earmarked for climate initiatives, you see? in fact, and i'm not an expert on interpreting these documents, it seems a rather large portion of our climate subsidies actually come from the defense budget 


// but the money was filtered and obfuscated in a way that makes it look like someone is trying to hide that  // probably skip this line 


and why are you bringing this to me, specifically?


for your advice


// goto 32.0

my advice is take the money 


what?


look, you're getting the money to fund your vision. the technicals of getting that money from the public to you are a little more complex than you realize. climate funding does not go nearly as far as military funding. // image management, political support, a lot of hidden work is required to fund projects like this. 


// my advice? my advice is politics is not your wheelhouse, clayton. the challenges in securing funding for a project like this requires managing complicated optics. climate projects don't receive this much funding. military projects do. 



32.0

// my advice?


// originally just a pregnant pause here 


// if i decide not to use the pause: yes. i value your input. i would have never have navigated any of this without your help. 

// probably cut above. i like the pause more 


// this is something you're concerned with?


yes, very 


well, I wouldn't be 


what, why, you don't think it's significant--


--clayton, projects receive funding under the table from the military all the time. your company wouldn't exist if it weren't for the military. you think congress could pass a climate spending bill for the amount of money you've received? 


but


// clayton, business is your world. politics is mine. // lobbying /


you want my advice? take the money


who cares where it comes // came // from?


goto 2024


---


note: at the end of the movie, the main character should throw his smart cameras in the trash (too obvious?)


---


cut from black 


we see a distorted, spherical reflection of a man pulling his bicycle into his drive way. 


a whirring sound, underneath the glass surface of the reflection is a camera lens autofocusing. the reflection shifts out of focus, revealing the watchful eye behind the reflection


---


can set a frame story using a "podcast" the main character has which is used to train the voice model against clayton 


---


can also have the main characters social engineer an assistant to get access to his location 


"he's in grave danger" etc 

// but he doesn't know it 


// "what?? why?"


notices blipping sound 


"what is this?"


"it's mr. stanford's heart beat"


"what?"


"it's mr stanford's heart beat"


"yeah, no, i mean why? how?"


"his smart watch! it transmits mr stanford's biometrics so i can monitor his vitals. breathing, heart rate, blood pressure. i like to listen to his heartbeat. it helps me sleep."


"it's kind of beautiful, knowing we're always connected..."


"i can tell you care about mr stanford a lot. and that's why you have to help us. listen to this voicemail:"


*AI generated voicemail* 


---

first foreshadowing that something is wrong, the main character fake asks: 


where are you?


---


need to foreshadow showing someone messing with eleventh labs doing deep fakes of morgan freeman 


could be either with a child family member or goofing off at the office 


can get morgan freeman to say the poop that took a pee


or use it to imitate clayton 


that's incredible! that sounds so good. can you do anyone's voice?


as long as there's enough audio samples of them speaking, yeah


oh shit, do you think we can do clayton?


oooooo


---

"Alright team, we need to go extremely hardcore mode"


"I inherited all my money and am desperate for everyone to like me!"


// inherited all my money from my dad's emerald mine 


"Haha what's that? Voice synthesis?"


Whoaa nope, hello sir. 


You don't need to call me sir. *notices words on screen* oh, haha. that's funny. *stutters* that's what'd i'd say if i cared about what people think of me. but i don't. 


// i only care about three things: intelligence, execution quotient, and judgement, and just now, i realized you exhibit none of those qualities. 


you're fired, and so is the person who hired you


// but you hired me


no kidding? i don't remember that 


no, i'm just kidding 


oh, good. well i'm not. 


clayton starts laughing  


everyone starts laughing uncomfortably


oh, i got you! i got him!


come on, you think I'd fire you for that? It might explain your compensation review, though! 😉 


oh darn, not again!


seriously though, what you wrote is libel, let's just understand that. ok, funs over, back to work. 


---


 throwaway shot of a guy in IT


hey, i can't log into my machine


oh, ok, let's take a look, what's your alias?


blej 


oh, I don't know how you to tell this--i'm not sure how I'm the first person to tell you this, it looks like you're marked as inactive in the system


inactive? as in terminated?


well, it doesn't distinguish but...

sir, have you checked chirp?

autonomous film 


incident where main character picks up character who does not realize they've been marked for death 


short way through a hectic car ride to a safe destination, they other character is explaining what they've learned 


just as the are about to deliver the truth bomb


the vehicle is suddenly struck with an autonomous vehicle 


the car goes flying in a traumatic crash scene


the other character is instantly silenced


a freak accident? or worse?


---


here's another death from 2020. ruled as driver at fault. // but look at these pictures. there's no way this was the driver's fault 


// this file's missi


// half of this file is redacted though. 


// what do you think they redacted?


i don't know


but i want to find out


(hint, it's dash footage)


---


eventually they find it 


it's dash footage of an original whistleblower of some type 



---


they aren't just building self driving cars, they are building ---


crash 


---


pov of dash cam


the vehicle has been pinned against the ledge of a cliff by the self driving car 


the driver floors the gas, but it's no use 


the self driving car slams once--the vehicle now teeters


the driver is fumbling with the car door, trying to get it to unlock 


the self driving car slams again, now harder, and the vehicle rocks


frantically screaming, the character ferociously shakes the handle to a broken car door, suddenly deciding to pound on the glass with her elbow 


one more final acceleration 


a horrid crash sound and twist of metal and the vehicle is now free from the ledge 


a moment of screams before the vehicle crashes down completely to the ground


and silence befalls the still night 


only the gentle hum of an electric car motor can be heard


as we see taillights swerve away 


---


ultimately i want the red herring villain character to get killed in his own self driving vehicle


his majority share holder will give a speech on tv covering the issue 


i've received news last night 

character name was killed in his own self driving car. 


he was traveling home late at night after we had spoke when his vehicle was blindsided, by a drunk driver 


there are those who say his self driving cars were dangerous


but who is dangerous?


our self driving cars have killed no one!


it's the PEOPLE who make the road dangerous 


and by fighting the progress of self driving cars, you people have killed the very person who brought that vision to life!


it is clear to me that the next step is to 


// we need to create roads that only self driving cars can use // by the end of this decade, i promise you, every vehicle on the road will be a self driving vehicle. and there will be ZERO vehicle deaths
