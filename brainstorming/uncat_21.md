AI via, or Aivia


The future... drives itself 


// from Viatech 


---


the aivia continues driving, but misses a turn


Elroy leans up, noticing the turn is missed


he says "you missed this turn"


slightly apprehensive


of course; there is no driver


he checks the app to figure out what is going wrong


but the app continues to show the route he inputted 


the same route it's not taking


he tries to cancel the ride to no avail


at the next stop light, he tries to open the door


it's locked 


eventually the vehicle carries him to Varick's office 


Varick Morris?


Morris Varick?


Dean Varick


Stanford 

Stanton 



Carson


Stanford Zimbardo

as he struggles to get up


broken from his injuries 


the aivia ghost"


"the aivia goliath / mammoth 


// the other ghosts along with his vehicle crash into the wall in a blaze of glory 


his silhouette crawling towards safety, the ground saturated with blood, is backlight by the flames 


the remaining ghost slowly about faces 


ominous headlights and a red glow fill the scene 


it slowly approaches 


it begins to pick up speed 


it gains momentum 


it reaches full speed


he inches towards an alley 


closer and closer, but not fast enough 


suddenly sirens and red and blue flashing lights enter the scene 


an ambulance flies into place between the ghost and the character 


the ghost, programmed to react to emergency vehicles, instinctively hard breaks and swerves, the red lights indicating its control mode dim, indicating it has gone passive


it spins out and lands parallel to the curb facing away


"GET IN!"


I can't move my legs!


character 2 hops out of the ambulance and hurries character 1 into the back 


just as she gets back into the drivers seat 


BWUMMMMMMMN


the low pulse and red lights trigger


the machine is back on kill mode


// maybe instead it swerves and rolls over several times and then crashes and burns. this ends the chase scene and allows our heroes to escape 


she floors it 


grunting in pain


"Why did it stop?"


"Programming. You can short its logic if you know how. It's programmed to stop for emergency vehicles."


"We need to get you somewhere safe, now"


"Where?"


"Off the grid."

---


movie should open with the unveiling of the aivia "goliath", a self driving semi truck


---


no, we're safe here


suddenly the glow of high beams and a red ambient light begin to grow brighter and brighter from beyond the shuttered blinds 


the silent goliath barrels towards the wall, until it trips the alarm 


they turn, look at the window, and see their formidable foe on an unstoppable path directly towards them


"MOVE!" character shouts 


they dart to either side just in time for the giant to come careening through the brick wall


smashing the window to pieces 


and plowing through the entire warehouse, unyielding 


finally, it comes to a stop, smoke everywhere 


silence, still


suddenly, they notice something off about its cargo 


...flammable material


// a trail of liquid 


"RUN!"


but it's too late 


BOOM!!


the warehouse explodes in a flurry of fire // inferno // tornado // 


character manages to duck down beneath some cover of some sort and survives


but when the fire clears 


other character is charred to a burnt crisp 


---


character realizes he's being tracked 


and hurls his phone into the fire in a rage 


---


he stops to grieve 


begins sobbing uncontrollably 


falling to he's knees


he shouts in torment 


(maybe other character is a woman who becomes a love interest of sorts) 


---


// never mind, the goliath needs to "die" to appear like a freak accident 


suddenly, a low humming pulse


BWUMMMMMMN


emanated from the goliath


it's red lights begin to glow


it starts 


---


how did they find us? 


your car keys 


what? 


do you still have your car keys


character 1 checks his pocket and feels around


his face turns to stone 


he says nothing 


that's how they find us


we still have 5 minutes before the ghosts arrive


that's plenty of time to upload the data 


the what?


then I can kill the airnet which will shut down the ghosts


they can't be controlled remotely without the internet and there's no cell towers for miles 


the airnet will self reboot within minutes


but that will give us enough time to escape 


where to?


i don't know


(the mean time, the goliath approaches) 


---


the ghosts have their own network, the goliaths have their own network. that's why character 2 couldn't see it coming 


---


"as soon as we're online, viatech will know where we are"


"that means we have an hour, maybe two hours tops, before they converge on our location" 


--- 


into the woods


deep into the woods


ghosts can't travel through dense foliage, they can't off road 


---


ghosts approach the wreckage


their doors open


suddenly, k9s burst out of the vehicle 


equipped with packs, cameras, and presumably satellite equipment 


character 1 hobbles through the woods


clutching the external drive with blood covered hands 


he talks a moment to rest 


suddenly, he hears the barking of attack dogs in the distance 


his breath fogs in the chill air


he is pale, and losing blood 


the he removes the gun strapped to his waist


the one he removed from officer's person after he was killed


// "can I get a gun?"

// what are you going to do? shoot the car to death? // kill the driver? 

// I could hit its tires 

// you think that would stop it?

// maybe 

// believe me, a gun won't help you here 


he clutches the gun 


the clouds part, a full moon illuminates the woods 


he ducks out of cover


"bang bang! bang! bang!"


the howels of dogs


barking halts 


silence 


he hobbles over to the canine 


affixed is a tracking computer 


// maybe he uses this to upload the data 


he moves himself into frame 


"Varick..." he says between heavy breaths, "I want to talk" 


he blacks out


he wakes up in a cabin 


a gentle fire flickers in a hearth 


--

 

you're awake 


a man sits across him in a lounge chair 


character 1  struggles to adjust 


"don't move" "you're restrained"


character 1 looks down and sees that his bound to the chair


"who sent you?"


character 1 rolls his head 


character 3 moves closer, lifts char1 by his chin to look him in the eyes 


"who sent you?"


"who... who are you?"


"that doesn't matter. you don't need to know who I am. you'll be dead soon. I thought you were already dead"


mumbling... "they know"


"they know? who knows? what do they know?"


"viatech... they know"


"know what? who sent you? CIA? viatech?"


"they know where I am. they'll find you"


sitting back down in his chair, leaning back, mulling this information over, character 3 strokes his chin


"CIA" // "Deep state." "How did you find me?"


"I don't know who you are"


Char2 shoves his hand into Char1's mouth, Char1 struggles, writhing in his chair 


"No cyanide tooth."


"I'm not... CIA... I'm being tracked... by the CIA"


Char3 sits back in his chair again.


"Me too. CIA has been tracking me for 30 years. I came out here, where they couldn't track me."


"But now, you led them right to me. // Them dogs had cameras. // Why?"


// "I need to stop them."


To get off the grid. 


Well, you're off the grid now buddy.
