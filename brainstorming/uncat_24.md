Dex first begins to notice something is off when he's reviewing information about
the test vehicles

Over 100 test vehicles location are unaccounted for, either the data is redacted or missing.

We eventually discover the truth to this matter when Dex meets Ex-Cop, who reports that the
vehicles were distributed to the police force for beta testing as police cruisers and crowd control
vehicles, which is when ex Cop started to start sleuthing himself, ultimately managing to secure
a video evidence tape of Mina Canario's death. Mina's vehicle was pinned down by an Aivia ghost, it
was pushed into a guardrail by a road cliffside. Slowly, with several crashing motions, it rammed her 
vehicle until it fell off the cliff. This is all from Mina's perspective from her dashcam.

This video is revealed to Dex at some point after the officer manages to contact him and arrange
to meet at a secret location.
