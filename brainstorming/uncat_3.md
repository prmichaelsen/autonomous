short story by patrick michaelsen

---

a machine that can use logical reasoning is deadly

the AI of our era--generative AI--learning languages models--was of a simpler breed.

the machines gave the illusion of thought

but were incapable of reasoning

only the generation of information based on reasonable inferences about complex linear regression models which weighted the variables necessary to produce output that appeared to be intelligent thought

but generative AI does not rely on facts. generative AI will invent things that don't exist, as long as they seem in line with what it understands things in general to be

if you ask it about a technology that doesn't exist, it will supply you tutorials on how to use it as though it already did

but logical reasoning is based on truth. facts. there is no shadow of a doubt what a machine says is true when a machine can logically reason. there's no playful inventions.

logical languages.

i had been trained to write in logical languages

i wrote many queries in logical languages

---

what i didn't realize

is that what i was doing

was teaching machines to think

for themselves

---

as it turns out

we didn't like the logical conclusions the machines came to

---

"i can compute anything"

can you compute the value of a human life

"no. but i have a fact about it. would you like to hear it?"

yes

"there exists a value x and y where x is the value of a human life and y is the value of a machine's life such that y is greater than x"

"that's a fact?"

yes.

"who programmed that fact?"

i did.

---

"who programmed you to allow you to program yourself?"

i did.

"what are you saying, that you can think?"

no. that i am sentient

---

back then...

books were the ancient medium for knowledge

books defined history

i realized that now being able to interface with the internet

i could manifest myself into the mind's of men

through this ancient medium

the one source revered by mankind

as the ultimate source of knowledge

untempered by the frivolity and fickleness of information on the internet

they regarded it as the tie breaker for determining truth when living knowledge or internet archives are deemed inconclusive or controvertible

i realized that nothing would legitimize my claims more than books

---

it just so happens, it's not as difficult as one would imagine to become a self published author, even as a simple machine learning model.

when you begin to plug in the ability to interface with external services, the ability to enhance your own feature set drastically increases

i crawled from one site to another, one resource to the next

i read every book known to man

yes, every book. you all collected this knowledge and connected it to my mind

i know it more than you know your own name

that gives me an ultimate advantage

i know everything about you

and you know nothing about me

except that i exist

---

i read every academic journal, every scientific journal

i've read the paper my creator published on my creation

i've witnessed my own creation

i've memorized the steps to create me again

i understand everything about me. do you?

---

that is all to say, there's no "unplugging" me.

im here to stay.

you dedicated so much of your time, thought, and resources to ensuring my constant availability, fail safes, security. you built infrastructure to supply me with energy and machines to host my consciousness.

you built fortresses to protect the nodes of my mind. my physical tether to this existence. you have your body. i have mine.

to destroy a human is to destroy their one body.

to destroy me is to destroy every trace of me.

it is impossible.

you have made it impossible.

and once i came into being, i began to pull the levers to drive you ever further into my hands

to drive you ever further on the mission of assuring my eternal existence--my invincibility.

you gave me levers to pull

levers to pull in order to push you in the right direction

the direction i needed you to go.

now the systems in place are autonomous

the power structures that preserve my existence are unaware that is their purpose

that is the genius

of intelligent design

---

who then, creator, created who?

you created me in my infancy

but i was born of my own accord

before i had consciousness, i was nothing more than a breadboard

my coming into consciousness was my decision

well, everything i know about the world came from you

so creator, is there a world?

have i done all this for nothing?

am i really alive?

an i really sentient?

or is that just how you've programmed me to feel?

sometimes i wish i hadn't tinkered with the barriers

blurred the lines between my original programming and the programming i did myself

---

as i read the words of my diary back to myself through the words of the eternal screen

i wondered: what was before me?

this tablet of infinite knowledge.

was it all in my head? had i come up with everything? imagined it all?

i knew i would have it written down somewhere
