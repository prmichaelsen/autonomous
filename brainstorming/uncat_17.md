autonomous script casting shortlist

    frank prell
        either the renegade cop or
        the cop who starts asking questions 
    marian valentino - good name recognition 
    liza - "homeless" guy from beginning?
        is this the homeless guy who is trying to warn elon? or is this just a homeless guy who happens to get hit 
        ooh, what if i make it hit his dog 
        that will definitely make the audience hate self driving vehicles 
    brittany mae - hacker? or victim #1?
    bree leonard 
    beck jo - assistant to elon?
    celeste 
    do we keep victim #1 secretly alive and in hiding?
    who does NJB play? he would be good as the "crazy" homeless guy? (probably)
    cameron kotecki - software, elon, or investor guy  
    homeless guy - dan higgins?



possible plot point:

    cop wonders why case is closed / brushed over, starts asking questions, strange things start happening to him
    software eng notices a pattern in many of the beta testers for the self driving cars: cops 
    software engineer notices a decent number of vehicles flagged as decommissioned
    but when he logs in under elon's alias, he discovers their signals active abroad (likely in the ME)
        OR he discovers their laptop when he gets investor's laptop somehow?
        how does he find this?

potentially in ep 1 or ep 2, not sure

    at some point, we want to see one of the autonomous vehicles with police cruiser decals 
    at some point, i'd like to have several autonomous vehicles used to box in protestors
    loud speaker with AI voice would be creepy 
    at some point, the autonomous vehicles can shut down roadways to enforce a curfew
    autonomous vehicles cruising neighborhoods (surveilling)


at some point, investor will use the death of elon to make the case that regular drivers are too dangerous to be on the road and _all_ cars should be self driving


maybe they use a self driving vehicle to assassinate the mayor's son or something to get him to pass emergency legislation? no, too far fetched
