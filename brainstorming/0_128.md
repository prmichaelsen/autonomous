INT. MID-DAY - Viatech Headquarters

Clayton rushes into the office, past reception and through rows of employees frantically typing or on calls.

Some personell, potentially a high ranking member of the company, chases down Clayton

“Clayton!” he says, and begins to speak

but Clayon’s ears are ringing, all he hears is that ringing, his vision is blurry and out of focus, He strides through the office, walking past employee after employee rising from their desk to get his attention.

Finally he reaches a door and opens it

His private office, corner office, massive, luxury

He slams it shut behind him and breathes a deep, nervous sigh of relief.

He looks up

“Close the blinds” says a figure standing by the window, not facing Clayton
