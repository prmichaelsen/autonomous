maybe the reason clayton confronts number one is number one invites him to his office to tell him to stop Dex from investigating

clayton starts to question this which leads to number one hint at where his funding has been coming from and he should just follow orders

orders?

look, you might fund this project etc...

eventually number one leads on that the military may be involved in his funding

"where do you think that money comes from?"

// aka the pentagon

military?

// maybe a pause

// the accidents

// those weren't accidents at all, were they?

"you better stop asking questions"
