# AUTONOMOUS - SCREENPLAY OUTLINE

## EXPOSITION (Act 1)

1. **Opening Scene**: An Aivia Ghost autonomous car kills a disheveled man (the "beggar") outside Aivia headquarters. The man was trying to warn Clayton Stanford about something related to his company. His dying words: "Stop... Viatech... Stop... Aivia."

2. **Introducing Clayton Stanford**: The visionary CEO of Aivia, who has revolutionized transportation with his self-driving vehicles. We see his ruthless, self-centered nature as he's more concerned with the company's image than the death.

3. **Introducing Dexton "Dex" Sharp**: Clayton's lead engineer who insists the technology is virtually infallible with "99.9% repeating to the 20th decimal place precision."

4. **The Pressure**: Clayton pressures Dex to find a scapegoat within 24 hours, threatening that Dex himself could "disappear" if he doesn't comply.

5. **The Perfect Record**: Establishment of Aivia's 14-month perfect safety record prior to this incident, and the upcoming launch of the Aivia Mammoth autonomous semi-truck.

6. **Clayton's Death**: Clayton becomes a target himself. Before he's killed, he manages to pass crucial information to Dex.

7. **The Ex-Engineer**: Dex goes on the run and meets an ex-Viatech security engineer who had discovered a backdoor in the autonomous vehicle systemâ€”a vulnerability the company refused to fix.

8. **The Upload Plan**: They plan to upload evidence of the assassinations using Clayton's phone.

9. **The Attack**: An Aivia Mammoth crashes into their hideout, killing the ex-engineer. Dex escapes with Clayton's phone.

11. **Off the Grid**: After being injured, Dex is found by a paranoid man living off the grid who eventually helps him.

12. **The Journey**: They travel 14 hours to a small town to access the internet.

## CLIMAX (Act 3)

1. **The Plan**: Dex devises a plan using "WRONG WAY" and "ROAD CLOSED" signs to confuse autonomous vehicles.

2. **Drawing Out the Enemy**: Dex calls Varick to draw him out.

3. **The Protest Control**: Simultaneously, autonomous vehicles with police markings are boxing in protesters in the city, creating an inescapable perimeter with AI voices issuing commands.

4. **The Approach**: Dex drives toward Viatech headquarters in a truck covered with road signs. The autonomous vehicles crash when they approach due to their emergency protocols.

5. **The Attack**: Varick uses a vehicle equipped with a 50-caliber machine gun to attack.
