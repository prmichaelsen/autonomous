# SCREENPLAY FORMATTING GUIDE

This guide outlines the standard screenplay format to be used for all scenes in the "Autonomous" screenplay.

## General Formatting Rules

1. **Page Layout**: Standard 8.5" x 11" page with 1" margins on all sides
2. **Font**: Courier or Courier New, 12-point
3. **Line Spacing**: Single-spaced
4. **Text Alignment**: 
   - Scene headings, action, and transitions: Left-aligned
   - Character names: Centered
   - Dialogue: Centered column (narrower than action text)
   - Parentheticals: Centered within dialogue column

## Scene Elements

### Scene Headings (Sluglines)
- ALL CAPS
- Left-aligned
- Format: INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY
- Example: `INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY`

### Action/Description
- Left-aligned
- Word-wrapped to fit the page width (with reasonable margins, ie 62 chars)
- Present tense
- Describes what the audience sees and hears
- Important elements (appearance of characters) in ALL CAPS

### Character Names
- ALL CAPS
- Centered above dialogue
- May include (V.O.) for voice-over or (O.S.) for off-screen
- Example: `CLAYTON`

### Parentheticals
- Lowercase, in parentheses
- Centered under character name, above dialogue
- Used sparingly to indicate how dialogue is delivered
- Example: `(whispering)`

### Dialogue
- Centered in a column (approximately 35 characters wide)
- Wrapped to maintain the column width
- Example:
```
          This is dialogue text that is
          centered in a column and wrapped
          to maintain proper width.
```

### Transitions
- ALL CAPS
- Right-aligned
- Used sparingly
- Examples: `CUT TO:`, `FADE TO:`, `DISSOLVE TO:`

## Special Formatting

### Intercut Scenes
- Use `INTERCUT WITH:` to indicate switching between two locations
- Continue with normal scene elements after establishing the intercut

### Montages
- Begin with `BEGIN MONTAGE:` and end with `END MONTAGE`
- Each montage shot can be a separate action paragraph or a series of shots with dashes

### Flashbacks
- Indicate with `FLASHBACK:` before the scene heading
- End with `END FLASHBACK`

## Example

```
FADE IN:

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A gleaming glass and steel skyscraper dominates the skyline.

                    BEGGAR
                    (under his breath)
          Clayton Stanford... Mr. Stanford... 
          I need to tell you something...

He paces nervously, checking his watch.

                    CLAYTON
          Get away from me!

CUT TO BLACK.
```

## Notes

1. Be consistent with formatting throughout the screenplay
2. Focus on visual storytelling - write what can be seen and heard
4. Use ALL CAPS for character name in actions, but not for verbs
5. Dialogue should be concise and character-driven
6. Keep action paragraphs as faithful to the brainstorming 
   material as possible
7. Focus on correct whitespace
   a. Dialogue should be centered
   b. Actions should be column wrapped to 60 characters
8. Generally, do not cut to black, instead cut to the 
   next scene
