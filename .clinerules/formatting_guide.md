# SCREENPLAY FORMATTING GUIDE

This guide outlines the standard screenplay format to be used for all scenes in the "Autonomous" screenplay.

## General Formatting Rules

1. **Page Layout**: Standard 8.5" x 11" page with 1" margins on all sides
2. **Font**: Courier or Courier New, 12-point
3. **Line Spacing**: Single-spaced
4. **Text Alignment**: 
   - Scene headings, action, and transitions: Left-aligned
   - Character names: Centered
   - Dialogue: Centered column (narrower than action text)
   - Parentheticals: Centered within dialogue column

## Scene Elements

### Scene Headings (Sluglines)
- ALL CAPS
- Left-aligned
- Format: INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY
- Example: `INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY`

### Action/Description
- Left-aligned
- Word-wrapped to fit the page width (with reasonable margins)
- Present tense
- Describes what the audience sees and hears
- Important elements (first appearance of characters, sounds, etc.) in ALL CAPS

### Character Names
- ALL CAPS
- Centered above dialogue
- May include (V.O.) for voice-over or (O.S.) for off-screen
- Example: `CLAYTON`

### Parentheticals
- Lowercase, in parentheses
- Centered under character name, above dialogue
- Used sparingly to indicate how dialogue is delivered
- Example: `(whispering)`

### Dialogue
- Centered in a column (approximately 35 characters wide)
- Wrapped to maintain the column width
- Example:
```
          This is dialogue text that is
          centered in a column and wrapped
          to maintain proper width.
```

### Transitions
- ALL CAPS
- Right-aligned
- Used sparingly
- Examples: `CUT TO:`, `FADE TO:`, `DISSOLVE TO:`

## Special Formatting

### Intercut Scenes
- Use `INTERCUT WITH:` to indicate switching between two locations
- Continue with normal scene elements after establishing the intercut

### Montages
- Begin with `BEGIN MONTAGE:` and end with `END MONTAGE`
- Each montage shot can be a separate action paragraph or a series of shots with dashes

### Flashbacks
- Indicate with `FLASHBACK:` before the scene heading
- End with `END FLASHBACK`

## Example

```
FADE IN:

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A gleaming glass and steel skyscraper dominates the skyline.

                    BEGGAR
                    (under his breath)
          Clayton Stanford... Mr. Stanford... 
          I need to tell you something...

He paces nervously, checking his watch.

                    CLAYTON
          Get away from me!

CUT TO BLACK.
```

## Notes

1. Be consistent with formatting throughout the screenplay
2. Focus on visual storytelling - write what can be seen and heard
3. Keep action paragraphs brief and focused (3-4 lines maximum)
4. Use ALL CAPS sparingly for emphasis and to highlight key elements
5. Dialogue should be concise and character-driven
