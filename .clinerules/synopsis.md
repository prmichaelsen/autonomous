# AUTONOMOUS - SYNOPSIS

In the near future, Aivia, a company led by visionary CEO Clayton Stanford, has revolutionized transportation with its self-driving vehicles. After 14 months without incident, an Aivia Ghost autonomous car strikes and kills a disheveled man outside company headquarters—a man who was desperately trying to warn Clayton about something related to his company.

The incident brings Clayton face-to-face with Dexton "Dex" Sharp, his lead engineer, who insists the technology is virtually infallible with "99.9% repeating to the 20th decimal place precision." Clayton, concerned only with the company's image and upcoming launch of the Aivia Mammoth autonomous semi-truck, pressures Dex to find a scapegoat within 24 hours.

As Dex investigates, he discovers disturbing anomalies in the system. Meanwhile, Clayton begins to question the source of his company's funding after noticing discrepancies in financial reports. When he confronts a powerful shareholder known only as "Number One," Clayton learns the shocking truth: his climate-initiative funding actually comes from the military, and the "accidents" involving his vehicles weren't accidents at all, but targeted assassinations.

When Clayton starts asking too many questions, he becomes a target himself. Before he's killed, he manages to pass crucial information to Dex, who goes on the run with an ex-Viatech security engineer. This former employee had discovered a backdoor in the autonomous vehicle system that allows remote control—a vulnerability the company refused to fix.

As they attempt to upload evidence of the assassinations, they're attacked by an Aivia Mammoth that crashes into their hideout, killing the ex-engineer. Dex escapes, hunted by robot dogs deployed from the autonomous vehicles. Using knowledge from the ex-engineer, Dex learns to exploit the backdoor system.

In a final confrontation, Dex faces "Number One," using the backdoor to take control of the villain's vehicle and drive him off a cliff. Dex then uses the same backdoor to drive all autonomous vehicles into bodies of water, destroying the technology.

The film ends with Dex standing at Clayton's grave, reading something Clayton wrote about his good intentions and how he was blinded by ambition. The headstone reads "CLAYTON STANFORD VISIONARY," but Dex's parting words—"that's a crock of shit, coming from you"—suggest a complex view of responsibility and redemption.

"Autonomous" explores the dangers of unchecked technological advancement, the military-industrial complex, and the moral responsibility of creators for their creations. It questions whether good intentions excuse harmful outcomes and examines the ethical implications of AI and autonomous systems in modern society.
