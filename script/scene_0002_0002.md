INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - EVENING

Dex sits alone at a metal table, handcuffed to a ring bolted to its center. 
The room is stark - white walls, fluorescent lights, a two-way mirror. A 
clock on the wall reads 5:17 PM.

Dex stares at his reflection in the mirror, exhausted. He glances at the 
clock repeatedly as time passes.

TIMELAPSE: The clock hands spin forward. 6:30... 7:45... 8:20...

The fluorescent lights flicker, casting harsh shadows across Dex's face. 
His expression shifts from fear to resignation.

EXT. REMOTE ROAD - NIGHT

A sleek black car - Clayton's vehicle - winds its way down a deserted 
mountain road. Headlights cut through the darkness, illuminating dense 
forest on either side.

INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

The clock now reads 9:05 PM. Dex's head rests on the table, eyes closed.

The door SLAMS open. AGENT RAVEL enters, his face stern.

Without a word, Ravel roughly yanks 
him to his feet. Dex stumbles as Ravel pushes him toward the door.

                    DEX
          Where are we going?

Ravel doesn't answer, just shoves him forward into the hallway.
