EXT. DOWNTOWN CITY STREETS - DAY

A PROTEST fills the streets. Hundreds of PROTESTERS carry signs with slogans like "STOP KILLER CARS" and "AIVIA = DEATH." The crowd is passionate but peaceful.

                    PROTEST LEADER
                    (through megaphone)
          Fourteen months of so-called 
          "safety," and now how many dead? 
          How many "accidents" that weren't 
          accidents at all?

The crowd ROARS in response.

ANGLE ON: A row of AIVIA GHOSTS with POLICE MARKINGS silently approaching the intersection. Their headlights pulse with an eerie RED GLOW.

                    PROTESTER #1
          Look! They're sending in the 
          robo-cops!

The autonomous police vehicles form a perimeter around the protest, boxing them in. Their movements are precise, coordinated - almost like a choreographed dance.

                    PROTESTER #2
          They can't just trap us here!

A protester tries to push past one of the vehicles. The Ghost smoothly moves to block their path, forcing them back.

ANGLE ON: The vehicles' external SPEAKERS activate with a CRACKLE.

                    AI VOICE
                    (from vehicle speakers)
          This is an unlawful assembly. 
          Disperse immediately or face arrest.

The voice is unnervingly calm, almost pleasant, despite the threatening message.

                    PROTEST LEADER
          We have a right to be here! We have 
          permits!

The autonomous vehicles begin to slowly close their perimeter, forcing the crowd to compress into a tighter space.

                    AI VOICE
          This is your final warning. Disperse 
          now.

                    PROTESTER #3
          They're going to crush us!

Panic begins to spread through the crowd. People push against each other, trying to find a way out.

A TECHNICIAN monitors multiple screens showing the protest from various angles. He speaks into a headset.

                    TECHNICIAN
          Perimeter established. Crowd 
          containment at 85% and increasing.

                    SUPERVISOR
          Good. Keep them there until the 
          police arrive with the mobile 
          processing units.

                    TECHNICIAN
          Sir, some of these people have 
          children with them.

                    SUPERVISOR
                    (coldly)
          Not my problem. They shouldn't have 
          brought kids to an illegal protest.

EXT. DOWNTOWN CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The autonomous vehicles continue to tighten their circle. Their red headlights cast an ominous glow over the frightened faces of the protesters.

Suddenly, one of the vehicles STOPS. Its headlights flicker.

                    TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
                    (over radio)
          Sir, we have a glitch in unit 12.

Another vehicle stops. Then another.

                    SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
          What's happening?

                    TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
          I don't know! We're losing control 
          of the units!

One by one, the vehicles' headlights change from red to normal. Their doors UNLOCK and pop open slightly.

                    PROTEST LEADER
                    (realizing)
          They've lost control! Everyone, move 
          now!

The protesters begin to escape through the gaps between vehicles.

INT. VIATECH CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

Chaos as screens show all vehicles shutting down simultaneously.

                    TECHNICIAN
          Sir, someone's overriding our 
          commands!

On one screen: A message appears: "SYSTEM COMPROMISED - CONTROL TRANSFERRED"

                    SUPERVISOR
          How is this possible?

                    TECHNICIAN
                    (checking systems)
          It's coming from inside the 
          building! Server room!

                    SUPERVISOR
                    (grabbing phone)
          Security to the server room now!

EXT. DOWNTOWN CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The protesters watch in amazement as the autonomous police vehicles suddenly drive away from the crowd, some crashing into each other, others driving directly into nearby fountains or reflecting pools.

                    PROTESTER #1
          What's happening to them?

                    PROTEST LEADER
                    (smiling)
          Someone's fighting back.

As the last of the vehicles drives itself into a decorative pond, the crowd CHEERS.

                    NEWS REPORTER
                    (to camera)
          In an unprecedented turn of events, 
          the autonomous police vehicles 
          deployed to contain today's protest 
          have apparently malfunctioned, with 
          some driving themselves into the 
          city's water features. This comes 
          amid growing concerns about the 
          safety and reliability of Aivia's 
          autonomous vehicle technology...

INT. VIATECH HEADQUARTERS - SERVER ROOM - SAME TIME

DEX watches the news feed on a small monitor while typing commands into a terminal. We recognize this as the same moment from Scene 4 where he's taking control of all autonomous vehicles.

                    DEX
                    (to himself)
          That's for trying to use my work 
          against people.

He continues typing, focused on his mission to destroy the autonomous vehicle network once and for all.

FADE TO BLACK.
