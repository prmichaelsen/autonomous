INT. MINA'S CAR - DASHCAM FOOTAGE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: Dashcam footage playing on Ravel's laptop. The timestamp in the 
corner shows 2:17 AM.

The footage is from inside MINA CANARIO's car, showing only the view 
through the windshield. She's driving on a winding cliffside road, mountains 
visible in the moonlight. The road is empty ahead of her.

Suddenly, the entire frame jerks violently as the car is hit from behind. 
The view through the windshield spins wildly - road, guardrail, night sky 
all blurring together as the car goes into an uncontrolled spin.

                    MINA (O.S.)
                    (screaming)
          AHHHHHHH!

The spinning stops abruptly as the car slams into something off-camera. 
The impact is jarring - the camera shakes violently. The view through the 
windshield now shows the edge of a cliff, with nothing but darkness beyond.

The frame suddenly jolts forward violently as something impacts the car 
from behind. The view tilts further, now showing more sky than road.

                    MINA (O.S.)
                    (screaming)
          AHHHHHHH!

Another violent jolt rocks the frame. The car lurches forward, the dashcam 
now tilting at an even steeper angle.

                    MINA (O.S.)
                    (screaming)
          AHHHHHHH!

One final, massive impact. The horizon suddenly tilts completely as the 
car breaks free from whatever was holding it.

                    MINA (O.S.)
                    (final scream)
          AHHHHHHHHHHH!

The dashcam footage becomes chaotic - spinning, tumbling, showing flashes 
of cliff face, sky, and ground as the car plummets. Mina's screams mix 
with the sound of metal crushing and glass breaking.

Then suddenly - silence. The camera continues recording, now upside down, 
showing the night sky through a shattered windshield. A pair of headlights 
briefly appears at the cliff edge above, shining down before disappearing.

The timestamp continues to tick forward in the corner of the screen.
