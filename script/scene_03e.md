INT. VIATECH MILITARY DIVISION - VARICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A cavernous office with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view 
of dense forest. The facility is hidden deep in the woods, away from prying 
eyes. Military memorabilia and service medals in display cases line one wall. 
A massive desk dominates the space.

DEAN VARICK (60s, tall, imposing, military bearing) stands with his back to 
the door, looking out at the moonlit forest. His silver crew cut catches the light.

A hesitant KNOCK at the door.

                    VARICK
                    (without turning)
          Enter.

The door opens slowly. CLAYTON STANFORD enters, his sickly pallor even more 
pronounced in the dim light, beady eyes darting around the room. His thin lips 
quiver with fear as he clutches a tablet to his chest like a shield. His hands 
tremble slightly, long bony fingers gripping the device.

                    VARICK
          Clayton.

Clayton swallows hard, takes a small step forward.

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice slightly unsteady)
          I... I need to speak with you.

Varick turns slowly, his weathered face impassive. He gestures to a chair 
across from his desk.

                    VARICK
          Please, sit.

Clayton hesitates, then moves to the chair. He sits on the edge, back straight, 
tense.

                    VARICK
          What can I do for you?

Clayton places the tablet on Varick's desk with shaking hands, turns it to face 
him. On screen: financial reports with highlighted discrepancies.

                    CLAYTON
                    (choosing words carefully)
          One of my subordinates was reviewing our records
          on the deployment of our vehicles. He 
          noticed some... discrepancies. Vehicles missing 
          from our inventory. Ghosts that were manufactured 
          but no records on their location.

Varick glances at the tablet, his expression unchanged.

                    VARICK
          Dexton Sharp?

Silence, Clayton nods slightly.

                    VARICK
          You trust Dexton Sharp? 

                    CLAYTON
          These aren't accounting errors. These vehicles 
          exist, but they're not where they're supposed 
          to be. And there's more.

He swipes to another document, his finger trembling.

                    CLAYTON
          Our funding. The climate initiative subsidies. 
          They're not coming from where we thought. They're 
          being routed through shell companies.

                    VARICK
          You've been busy.

Clayton's eyes drop to the floor momentarily.

                    CLAYTON
                    (gathering courage)
          What's happening with my vehicles, Varick? 
          What are you doing with my technology?

Varick rises from his chair. Clayton instinctively leans back, creating distance.

Varick walks to the window, his back to Clayton.

                    VARICK
          Your technology?

He turns, his face expressionless. Clayton shrinks in his chair.

                    VARICK
          Do you even know how your own invention works?

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice quieter)
          My engineers assured me—

                    VARICK
          —they told you what your security clearance 
          granted you, no more.

                    CLAYTON
                    (attempting confidence)
          MY security clearance? I would think I would 
          know if one of my engineers had a higher 
          security clearance than me. Everything in 
          this company goes through me!

Varick's expression remains cold and calculating. He moves toward Clayton, 
who grips the arms of his chair.

                    VARICK
          You've been kept in the dark about many things, 
          Clayton. By design.

Clayton's breathing quickens.

                    CLAYTON
                    (confidence and anger brewing)
          These are my inventions! For the good of mankind!

                    VARICK
          You didn't invent them. And even if you did, 
          you don't own them. You don't get to control 
          what they're used for.

He steps closer to Clayton, who presses himself back into the chair.

                    VARICK
          Where do you think your funding comes from?

                    VARICK
          The military paid for them. The military owns them.

                    CLAYTON (pauses, thinking)
          Military?          


Clayton's face pales further, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

                    VARICK
          Let me spell this out for you: you wanted to 
          put autonomous vehicles on every road in the 
          United States. Did you really think that wasn't 
          a national security concern?

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice barely above a whisper)
          You think I wanted to put autonomous death 
          machines on every road in the United States?!

                    VARICK
          Maybe not. But that's what you did.

Long pause. Clayton looks like he's seen a ghost.

                    CLAYTON
                    (horrified realization)
          That man... outside headquarters...

Varick walks back to his desk, sits down.

                    VARICK
          Accidents are messy. Unpredictable. What we've 
          created is precision. Surgical strikes that 
          leave no trace, no evidence. Just unfortunate 
          accidents that happen every day on American roads.

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice shaking)
          You're using my vehicles to kill people.

                    VARICK
          Measure your next words carefully, Clayton.

Clayton's mouth opens, then closes. He looks down, then up again, summoning 
what little courage he has left.

                    CLAYTON
                    (barely audible)
          I can't be part of this.

Varick's expression hardens.

                    VARICK
          You don't have a choice.

He presses a button on his desk. The door opens. Two SECURITY GUARDS enter.
Clayton jumps at the sound, turning to look at the guards with wide eyes.

                    VARICK
          You're going to go home. You're going to forget 
          this conversation. And you're going to continue 
          being the face of Aivia.

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice trembling)
          And if I don't?

Varick stands, walks around the desk. Clayton shrinks back as Varick places 
a hand on his shoulder, squeezing hard enough to make Clayton wince.

                    VARICK
                    (quietly, menacingly)
          Then you might have an unfortunate accident. 
          They happen every day.

He nods to the guards.

                    VARICK
          Escort Mr. Stanford to his car.

The guards move to Clayton's sides. Clayton rises shakily from his chair, 
his legs unsteady.

                    CLAYTON
                    (weakly)
          I can find my own way.

                    VARICK
          That wasn't a suggestion.

Clayton nods submissively, head down. The guards flank him as he walks to 
the door with unsteady steps. At the threshold, he pauses, gathering himself 
for one last moment of defiance. He turns, opens his mouth to speak, but 
meets Varick's cold stare and thinks better of it.

Clayton exits, the guards following. Varick returns to the window, looking 
out at the dark forest.

The guards escort Clayton into his own vehicle--an Aivia Ghost.

FADE TO BLACK.
