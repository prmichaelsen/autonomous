INT. VIATECH MILITARY DIVISION - VARICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A cavernous office with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view 
of dense forest. The facility is hidden deep in the woods, away from prying 
eyes. Military memorabilia and service medals in display cases line one wall. 
A massive desk dominates the space.

DEAN VARICK (60s, tall, imposing, military bearing) stands with his back to 
the door, looking out at the moonlit forest. His silver crew cut catches the light.

A KNOCK at the door.

                    VARICK
                    (without turning)
          You've been on the news a lot lately. 
          So has Aivia.

                  CLAYTON

          I'll admit the situation is not... ideal.

                  VARICK
          That's a light way to put it.

The door opens. CLAYTON STANFORD enters, his face tense, determined. He 
carries a tablet.

                    VARICK
          Clayton.

                    CLAYTON
          I need answers.

Varick turns slowly, his weathered face impassive. He gestures to a chair 
across from his desk.

                    VARICK
          Please, sit.

Clayton remains standing.

                    CLAYTON
          I'd rather stand.

Varick studies him for a moment, then moves to his desk and sits, leaning 
back in his chair with cold authority.

                    VARICK
          What can I do for you?

Clayton places the tablet on Varick's desk, turns it to face him. On screen: 
financial reports with highlighted discrepancies.

                    CLAYTON
          I've been going through our financial records. 
          There are discrepancies. Vehicles missing from 
          our inventory. Ghosts that were manufactured 
          but no records on their location.

Varick glances at the tablet, his expression unchanged.

                    VARICK
          And you came all this way to discuss inventory 
          management?

Clayton swipes to another document.

                    CLAYTON
          These aren't accounting errors. These vehicles 
          exist, but they're not where they're supposed 
          to be. And there's more.

He swipes again, showing another report.

                    CLAYTON
          Our funding. The climate initiative subsidies. 
          They're not coming from where we thought. They're 
          being routed through shell companies.

                    VARICK
          You've been busy.

Clayton stands his ground, looking directly at Varick.

                    CLAYTON
          What's happening with my vehicles, Varick? 
          What are you doing with my technology?

Varick studies Clayton for a long moment, then walks to the window.

                    VARICK
          Your technology?

He turns, his face expressionless.

                    VARICK
          Do you even know how your own invention works?

                    CLAYTON
          My engineers assured me—

                    VARICK
          —they told you what your security clearance 
          granted you, no more.

                    CLAYTON
          MY security clearance? I would think I would 
          know if one of my engineers had a higher 
          security clearance than me. Everything in 
          this company goes through me!

Varick's expression remains cold and calculating.

                    VARICK
          You've been kept in the dark about many things, 
          Clayton. By design.

Clayton's face flushes with anger.

                    CLAYTON
          These are my inventions! For the good of mankind!

                    VARICK
          You didn't invent them. And even if you did, 
          you don't own them. You don't get to control 
          what they're used for.

He steps closer to Clayton.

                    VARICK
          The military paid for them. The military owns them.

Clayton's face pales as the full reality hits him.

                    VARICK
          Let me spell this out for you: you wanted to 
          put autonomous vehicles on every road in the 
          United States. Did you really think that wasn't 
          a national security concern?

                    CLAYTON
          You think I wanted to put autonomous death 
          machines on every road in the United States?!

                    VARICK
          Maybe not. But that's what you did.

Long pause. Clayton looks like he's seen a ghost.

                    CLAYTON
          That man... outside headquarters...

Varick walks back to his desk, sits down.

                    VARICK
          Accidents are messy. Unpredictable. What we've 
          created is precision. Surgical strikes that 
          leave no trace, no evidence. Just unfortunate 
          accidents that happen every day on American roads.

                    CLAYTON
          You're using my vehicles to kill people.

                    VARICK
          Measure your next words carefully, Claton.

Clayton pauses for a long time.

                    CLAYTON
          I'm going to stop this.

Varick's expression hardens.

                    VARICK
          No, you're not.

He presses a button on his desk. The door opens. Two SECURITY GUARDS enter.

                    VARICK
          You're going to go home. You're going to forget 
          this conversation. And you're going to continue 
          being the face of Aivia.

                    CLAYTON
          And if I don't?

Varick stands, walks around the desk again. He places a hand on Clayton's 
shoulder, squeezing just a little too hard.

                    VARICK
          Then you might have an unfortunate accident. 
          They happen every day.

He nods to the guards.

                    VARICK
          Escort Mr. Stanford to his car.

The guards move to Clayton's sides. Clayton shrugs them off.

                    CLAYTON
          I can find my own way.

He turns to leave, then stops at the door.

                    VARICK
          That wasn't a suggestion.

Clayton exits, the guards following. Varick returns to the window, looking 
out at the dark forest.

The guards escort Clayton into his own vehicle--an Aivia Ghost.

FADE TO BLACK.
