EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

The car finally stops in a small clearing. Ravel gets out, silently walks 
to the trunk. Dex watches through the rear window.

Ravel yanks open the back door and drags Dex out, throwing him to the ground.
In one fluid motion, he draws his gun and grabs Dex by the head, pressing
the barrel against his temple.

                    DEX
          Officer, please—

                    AGENT RAVEL
                    (exploding)
          SHUT UP!

Ravel's hand trembles as he presses the gun harder against Dex's head.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          YOU KILLED MY DAUGHTER!

                    DEX
                    (terrified)
          I didn't—I swear—

Ravel cocks the hammer.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          SAY IT! SAY YOU KILLED HER!

                    DEX
          Please... I didn't do this. There's more 
          this... there's... there's more...

Ravel's finger tightens on the trigger. A moment of terrible tension.

Then, slowly, Ravel lowers the gun. Trembling, he stumbles back against 
his vehicle, slides to the ground, and begins silently sobbing, his face 
in his hands.

After a long silence, he looks up at Dex, his voice gentle.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I believe you. I wanted to believe you. 
          But I had to be sure.

A long pause as they stare at each other.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          This isn't the first time these things 
          have killed someone.

CUT TO BLACK.
