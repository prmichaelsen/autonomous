INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - OUTSIDE CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Dex steps out to face the entire team standing gathered outside Clayton's door.

Pause.

                    ENGINEER #1
          What did he say?

                    DEX
          He's a little upset.

Beat.

                    DEX
          How do you feel about sleeping in 
          the office tonight?

                    ENGINEER #2
          Judging by what I heard from that 
          conversation, I don't think any of 
          us are sleeping tonight.

                    DEX
          Yeah, I probably couldn't sleep if 
          I wanted to.

                    DEX
          Unless you're interested in taking 
          the fall for me?

                    ENGINEER #2
          Well, let's just say it's a good 
          thing he's coming after you, and not 
          me.

                    DEX
          And why's that?

                    ENGINEER #2
          Because I sure as fuck don't want to 
          be in the hotseat.
