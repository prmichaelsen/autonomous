INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - TECHNICAL LAB - NIGHT

The office is mostly empty, lights off. Only a few workstations are 
occupied. DEX sits at his desk, surrounded by multiple screens. The only 
light comes from the monitors, casting a blue glow on his exhausted face. 
Empty coffee cups litter the desk.

Across the room, DMITRI works silently at his station. A FEW OTHER ENGINEERS 
are scattered throughout the large space, all focused on their own tasks.

He's reviewing data logs from the accident, scrolling through lines of 
code and vehicle telemetry.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: Vehicle diagnostic data showing normal operations, then 
a sudden override command followed by acceleration.

                    DEX
                    (to himself)
          This doesn't make sense...

He pulls up another screen showing a database of all Aivia test vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: A spreadsheet with hundreds of entries. Many have 
location data, but over 100 entries show "LOCATION DATA UNAVAILABLE" or 
"ACCESS RESTRICTED."

DEX narrows his eyes, types rapidly.

                    DEX
          Computer, show me all vehicles with 
          restricted location data for the past 
          six months.

DMITRI eyes DEX. The computer processes. A new screen appears showing a timeline with 
clusters of vehicles going dark at specific dates.

DEX leans forward, puzzled.

                    DEX
          That's weird... over a hundred vehicles 
          unaccounted for.

He tries another command.

                    DEX
          Show deployment locations for restricted 
          vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: "ACCESS DENIED - SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED"

                    DEX
          What the hell?

He tries a different approach, typing rapidly.

                    DEX
          Show shipping manifests for all vehicles 
          manufactured in the last year.

A new screen appears with shipping data. Dex scrolls through it, then stops suddenly.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: Several entries showing vehicles shipped to various locations 
in the Middle East.

                    DEX
                    (whispering)
          The middle east... that can't be right.

He quickly downloads the vehicle inventory data and shipping manifests to a secure drive.

Through the window, the first light of dawn begins to break. DEX glances 
over at DMITRI, who's still working diligently.

                    DEX
          Another all-nighter, Dmitri? You know what 
          they say about all work and no play...

                    DMITRI
                    (without looking up)
          It keeps you out of federal prison?

                    DEX
          Well, I think I found something interesting.
          There's over 100 Ghosts that aren't accounted for.

                    DMITRI
          That is... interesting.

DEX turns back to his screen and continues working.
