INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

CLAYTON sits behind his desk, reviewing the data DEX has presented. His 
expression darkens with each slide.

                    CLAYTON
                    (seething)
          I want to congratulate you on finding me nothing.

                    DEX
          Over a hundred of them, Clayton. With 
          restricted access that even I can't get into. 
          Why would our own vehicles be classified?

                    DEX
          And there's more. I've been looking at the 
          financial records too. The funding doesn't 
          add up. I can't account for where all the 
          money for this project is coming from. The 
          climate initiative grants only cover about 
          60% of our operational costs.

CLAYTON SLAMS his fist on the desk, stands abruptly.

                    CLAYTON
          You're an engineer.
          Find the engineering faults.

                    DEX
                    (exhausted but determined)
          I'm just showing you what I found, Clayton.
          I can't explain it, but something's not right.

                    CLAYTON
          I gave you 24 hours. I was very clear about 
          what would happen if you didn't deliver.

                    CLAYTON (cont)
          Time's up, Dex.

                    DEX
          For God's sake, Clayton! I'm trying to protect 
          the company! Don't you want to know why our 
          own vehicles are being hidden from us?

CLAYTON's expression shifts from anger to cold calculation. He moves toward the window.

Blue and red lights begin to flash through the glass, illuminating the room in pulses.

                    CLAYTON
          Time's up, Dex.

DEX stares at him, realization dawning as the police lights fill the room.

The office door opens. Two FBI AGENTS in suits enter, followed by 
more agents. Everything seems to slow down for Dex. Sound fades 
away.

                    AGENT #1 (inaudible)
          Dexton Sharp?

DEX turns. 

                    DEX (inaudible)
          Yes?

                    AGENT #1 (inaudible)
          We'd like you to come with us. We have a few
          questions.

SLOW MOTION: The agents approach, their movements fluid yet deliberate. 
Sound becomes muffled, distant. One agent pulls out handcuffs that glint 
in the office light.

DEX watches, almost detached, as they grab his arms. The cold metal of 
handcuffs clicks around his wrists.

                    CLAYTON (V.O)
          You know what happens now, Dex? You disappear. 
          You'll spend the rest of your life in a cell. 
          No one will remember your name. Your family 
          will never know what happened to you. Just 
          another brilliant mind... gone.

                    DEX (V.O)
          I didn't do this! You know I didn't do this!

                    CLAYTON (V.O)
          No, Dex. You did.
