# SCREENPLAY PAGE COUNT ESTIMATE

## Current Scene Lengths

| Scene | Line Count | Estimated Pages |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Scene 1 | 175 | 3.2 |
| Scene 2 | 323 | 5.9 |
| Scene 3 | 260 | 4.7 |
| Scene 3b | 171 | 3.1 |
| Scene 4 | 264 | 4.8 |
| Scene 5 | 165 | 3.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **1358** | **24.7** |

*Based on standard screenplay format with approximately 55 lines per page*

## Progress Toward Target

- **Current estimated length:** 25 pages
- **Target length:** 80-100 pages
- **Current progress:** 25-31.3% complete

## Remaining Scenes to Develop

According to our development notes, we still need to create the following scenes:

1. **Clayton's Death Scene:** Clayton becomes a target after discovering the truth
2. **Introduction of Ex-Engineer:** Dex meets the ex-Viatech security engineer
3. **Backdoor Discovery:** Scene showing how they plan to use the backdoor in the system
4. **Hideout Attack:** The Aivia Mammoth crashing into their hideout, killing the ex-engineer
5. **Robot Dog Chase:** Dex being hunted by robot dogs in the woods (which leads to his injuries before meeting the Off-Grid Man)
6. **Small Town Upload:** More detailed scene of their journey to the small town to access the internet
7. **Resolution:** Expanded final scene of Dex at Clayton's grave

## Estimated Final Length

Assuming the remaining scenes average 7-10 pages each (some will be shorter, some longer):

- 7 remaining scenes Ã— 7-10 pages = 49-70 additional pages
- Current 25 pages + 49-70 additional pages = **74-95 pages total**

This would put us within our target range of 80-100 pages for an 80-100 minute film.

## Notes

- Action sequences (like the Robot Dog Chase) may require more pages to describe but translate to similar screen time
- Dialogue-heavy scenes (like Clayton's confrontation with Varick) may have more lines but fewer pages due to formatting
- The current scenes are well-developed and properly formatted, providing a solid foundation for the screenplay
