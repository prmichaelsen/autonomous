## Progress Toward Target

- **Current estimated length:** 40.4 pages
- **Target length:** 80-100 pages
- **Current progress:** 40-50% complete

## Remaining Scenes to Develop

According to our development notes, we still need to create the following scenes:

1. **Clayton's Death Scene:** Clayton becomes a target after discovering the truth
2. **Introduction of Ex-Engineer:** Dex meets the ex-Viatech security engineer
3. **Backdoor Discovery:** Scene showing how they plan to use the backdoor in the system
4. **Hideout Attack:** The Aivia Mammoth crashing into their hideout, killing the ex-engineer
5. **Robot Dog Chase:** Dex being hunted by robot dogs in the woods (which leads to his injuries before meeting the Off-Grid Man)
6. **Small Town Upload:** More detailed scene of their journey to the small town to access the internet
7. **Resolution:** Expanded final scene of Dex at Clayton's grave

## Estimated Final Length

Assuming the remaining scenes average 7-10 pages each (some will be shorter, some longer):

- 7 remaining scenes Ã— 7-10 pages = 49-70 additional pages
- Current 40.4 pages + 49-70 additional pages = **89.4-110.4 pages total**

This would put us within our target range of 80-100 pages for an 80-100 minute film.

## Notes

- We've improved the screenplay structure by splitting larger scenes into more focused segments
- The addition of the dashcam footage scene (scene_0002_0014.md) creates a powerful visual moment
- The lampshading dialogue about Clayton not using autonomous vehicles adds character depth
- The Middle East connection in scene_0001_0128.md strengthens the military conspiracy plot
- Action sequences (like the Robot Dog Chase) may require more pages to describe but translate to similar screen time
- Dialogue-heavy scenes (like Clayton's confrontation with Varick) may have more lines but fewer pages due to formatting
- The current scenes are well-developed and properly formatted, providing a solid foundation for the screenplay
