INT. FBI DETENTION CENTER - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Dex sits in the back, separated by a cage. Ravel drives in complete silence, 
eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, never looking back. The tension is palpable.

They pass a roadside memorial with flowers and a child's teddy bear. 
Ravel's knuckles whiten on the steering wheel.

The city lights fade behind them as Ravel takes an exit, then another. 
The roads become narrower, less traveled. Dex shifts uncomfortably but 
remains silent.

Ravel drives onto a dirt road. The cruiser bounces over ruts and potholes. 
He begins to speak, his voice quiet at first, eyes fixed straight ahead, 
never looking back at Dex.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          Her name was Emma. Eight years old.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She loved butterflies. Had this collection 
          of them on her wall. Drew them everywhere.

His voice grows softer, more distant. Tears begin to well in his eyes, 
but his gaze remains locked on the road ahead.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She wanted to be a scientist. Study 
          insects. So smart. So damn smart.

He wipes at his eyes with one hand, still driving.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          Every night, she'd tell me about some 
          new fact she learned. Did you know 
          butterflies taste with their feet? 
          She told me that.

The car slows as they reach a clearing in the woods. Ravel stops the car, 
turns off the engine. His shoulders begin to shake.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She was in our front yard. Playing. 
          There was this butterfly... blue one. 
          She... she chased it into the street.

His voice breaks. Tears streaming down his face.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I saw it happen. She ran into the street... 
          right in front of the car. It should have 
          stopped. It should have seen her. Why didn't
          it see her?

He swallows hard.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I ran to her. Held her in my arms. So 
          small. So... broken.

His knuckles turn white on the steering wheel.

                    AGENT RAVEL
                    (whispers to himself)
          She just loved butterflies.

Suddenly, he makes a hard turn off the road. The cruiser lurches as it 
leaves the pavement, bouncing violently over rough terrain. Dex is thrown 
against the cage as they crash through underbrush.

The car finally stops in a small clearing. Ravel gets out, silently walks 
to the trunk. Dex watches through the rear window.

Ravel yanks open the back door and drags Dex out, throwing him to the ground.
In one fluid motion, he draws his gun and grabs Dex by the head, pressing
the barrel against his temple.

                    DEX
          Officer, please—

                    AGENT RAVEL
                    (exploding)
          SHUT UP!

Ravel's hand trembles as he presses the gun harder against Dex's head.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          YOU KILLED MY DAUGHTER!

                    DEX
                    (terrified)
          I didn't—I swear—

Ravel cocks the hammer.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          SAY IT! SAY YOU KILLED HER!

                    DEX
          Please... I didn't do this. There's more 
          this... there's... there's more...

Ravel's finger tightens on the trigger. A moment of terrible tension.

Then, slowly, Ravel lowers the gun. Trembling, he stumbles back against 
his vehicle, slides to the ground, and begins silently sobbing, his face 
in his hands.

After a long silence, he looks up at Dex, his voice gentle.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I believe you. I wanted to believe you. 
          But I had to be sure.

A long pause as they stare at each other.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          This isn't the first time these things 
          have killed someone.

CUT TO BLACK.
