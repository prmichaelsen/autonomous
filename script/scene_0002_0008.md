INT. RAVEL'S HOME - NIGHT

A dimly lit living room. Sparse furniture, minimalist decor. The home of 
a man who barely lives there. A wall with framed photos - most featuring 
a smiling young girl with butterfly clips in her hair.

Dex is seated at the dining room table, still processing the 
events in the woods. His hands are no longer cuffed, but he remains tense, 
ready to move if needed.

Ravel enters from another room carrying a laptop and a box of files. He 
places them on the coffee table between them.

                    RAVEL
          I've been collecting evidence for months.

He opens the laptop, types briefly. Turns it to face Dex.

ON SCREEN: Police report for Senator Harmon's death. Cause listed as 
"single vehicle accident, driver impairment suspected."

                    RAVEL
          This was Senator Harmon's "accident." 
          Official report said he was drunk. He 
          wasn't. He chaired a committee investigating 
          accidents involving Aivia Ghosts.

Ravel scrolls to another document.

ON SCREEN: Another police report, this one for a pedestrian fatality.

                    RAVEL
          Advocate for laws against self-driving cars. 
          Three weeks before she was scheduled to testify 
          against Viatech.

Dex leans forward, studying the reports intently.

                    DEX
          ...these aren't glitches. The vehicles are 
          being controlled.

                    RAVEL
          Exactly. And this last one...

Ravel pulls up another file on the laptop.

                    RAVEL
          Mina Canario.

Dex's eyes widen in recognition.

                    DEX
          Mina... she died in an accident... her car 
          tumbled off a cliff.

                    RAVEL
          No. Not an accident.

                    RAVEL (cont)
          I was the first responder to her crash. Officially 
          the report was a hit and run. Aivia was 
          missing from the report. I was supposed to 
          collect the evidence, file the dashcam footage. 
          But instead. I didn't file it. I took it home.

Without another word, Ravel clicks play on a video file.
