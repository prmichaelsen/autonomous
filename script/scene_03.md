INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Clayton sits alone at his desk, illuminated only by his computer screen. The office is dark except for this blue glow. He looks exhausted, tie loosened, hair disheveled.

On his screen: financial reports, spreadsheets, funding allocations. He scrolls through documents, brow furrowed in concentration.

He stops at a particular line item, squints, then types rapidly. New windows open as he digs deeper into the financial trail.

CLAYTON
(muttering)
That can't be right...

He picks up his phone, dials.

CLAYTON
(into phone)
I need the complete funding allocation reports 
for the last three years. Yes, now. I don't care 
if it's after hours.

He hangs up, continues scrolling. A notification pops up on his screen: "Files Received." He opens them, his face illuminated by the changing light of the screen.

His expression shifts from confusion to concern to alarm.

CLAYTON
What the hell?

He grabs a pen, jots down notes on a pad. We see phrases like "DOD allocation," "redirected funds," "classified project codes."

A KNOCK at the door startles him.

CLAYTON
Come in.

His ASSISTANT (30s) enters with a folder.

ASSISTANT
The files you requested, sir. Is everything alright?

CLAYTON
(distracted)
Fine. Thank you.

The assistant leaves. Clayton opens the folder, spreads physical documents across his desk. He compares them with what's on his screen, connecting dots.

He sits back in his chair, a realization dawning on him.

CLAYTON
(to himself)
The green subsidies... they're not from climate 
initiatives.

He picks up his phone again, hesitates, then dials.

CLAYTON
(into phone)
I need to see you. Tomorrow morning. It's about 
the funding discrepancies.

(listens)
No, this can't wait. My office, 8 AM.

He hangs up, stares at the documents spread before him.

CUT TO:

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Clayton paces nervously. The blinds are open, morning light streaming in. The documents from last night are neatly organized on his desk.

A KNOCK at the door.

CLAYTON
Come in.

NUMBER ONE (60s), distinguished, silver-haired, in an expensive suit, enters. He carries himself with quiet authority.

NUMBER ONE
Clayton. You sounded concerned on the phone.

CLAYTON
Please, sit down.

Number One sits across from Clayton's desk. Clayton remains standing.

CLAYTON
I've been going over finances recently.

NUMBER ONE
Have you?

CLAYTON
Yes, one of my subordinates directed my attention 
to what appears to be a discrepancy in the green 
subsidies filing.

NUMBER ONE
The green subsidies filing, huh? Let me get ahead 
of you on this one, Clayton. If you're worried 
about embezzlement--

CLAYTON
No, no, that's not the case at all. Besides, I have 
plenty of money.

(beat)
It's just, well, we traced some of the funding from 
how it was earmarked by the federal government and 
how it reached our cash reserves.

NUMBER ONE
OK.

CLAYTON
And you see, not all of it is from funding earmarked 
for climate initiatives. In fact, and I'm not an expert 
on interpreting these documents, it seems a rather large 
portion of our climate subsidies actually come from the 
defense budget.

Number One studies Clayton's face, then leans back in his chair.

NUMBER ONE
And why are you bringing this to me, specifically?

CLAYTON
For your advice.

Number One pauses, considering his response.

NUMBER ONE
My advice is take the money.

CLAYTON
(surprised)
What?

NUMBER ONE
Look, you're getting the money to fund your vision. 
The technicals of getting that money from the public 
to you are a little more complex than you realize. 
Climate funding does not go nearly as far as military 
funding.

Clayton sits down, processing this.

CLAYTON
This is something you're concerned with?

NUMBER ONE
Yes, very.

CLAYTON
Well, I wouldn't be--

NUMBER ONE
(interrupting)
--Clayton, projects receive funding under the table 
from the military all the time. Your company wouldn't 
exist if it weren't for the military. You think Congress 
could pass a climate spending bill for the amount of 
money you've received?

CLAYTON
But--

NUMBER ONE
You want my advice? Take the money. Who cares where 
it came from?

Clayton's expression hardens as realization dawns.

CLAYTON
Where do you think that money comes from?

Number One's expression shifts subtly, becoming colder.

NUMBER ONE
(after a pause)
The accidents.

CLAYTON
What's that?

NUMBER ONE
The truth about where the company's funding comes from.

Clayton stares at him, processing the implications.

CLAYTON
But... those weren't accidents at all, were they?

Number One stands, straightening his suit.

NUMBER ONE
Oh, Clayton, do you even know how your own invention works?

CLAYTON
My engineers assured me--

NUMBER ONE
--they told you what your security clearance granted you, 
no more.

CLAYTON
MY security clearance? I would think I would know if one 
of my engineers had a higher security clearance than me. 
Everything in this company goes through me!

Number One smiles coldly.

NUMBER ONE
You look 5'11". Do you put 6 foot in your dating profile?

Clayton stands, anger rising.

CLAYTON
These are my inventions! For the good of mankind!

NUMBER ONE
You didn't invent them. And even if you did, you don't 
own them. You don't get to control what they're used for.

(beat)
The military paid for them. The military owns them.

Clayton's face pales as the full reality hits him.

NUMBER ONE
Let me spell this out for you: you wanted to put autonomous 
vehicles on every road in the United States. Did you really 
think that wasn't a national security concern?

CLAYTON
You think I wanted to put autonomous death machines on 
every road in the United States?!

NUMBER ONE
Maybe not. But that's what you did.

Long pause. Clayton looks like he's seen a ghost.

NUMBER ONE
You better stop asking questions.

Number One walks to the door, stops, and turns back.

NUMBER ONE
The Mammoth unveiling is in three days. Make sure it goes 
smoothly. We have plans for it.

He exits, leaving Clayton standing alone, shaken to his core.

Clayton slowly moves to his desk, collapses into his chair. He opens his drawer, pulls out a bottle of whiskey and a glass. His hands shake as he pours.

CLAYTON
(whispers)
What have I done?

CUT TO BLACK.
