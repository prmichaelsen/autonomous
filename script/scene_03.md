INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Clayton sits alone at his desk, illuminated only by his computer screen. 
The office is dark except for this blue glow. He looks exhausted, tie 
loosened, hair disheveled.

On his screen: financial reports, spreadsheets, funding allocations. He 
scrolls through documents, brow furrowed in concentration.

He stops at a particular line item, squints, then types rapidly. New 
windows open as he digs deeper into the financial trail.

                    CLAYTON
                    (muttering)
          That can't be right...

He picks up his phone, dials.

                    CLAYTON
                    (into phone)
          I need the complete funding allocation 
          reports for the last three years. Yes, 
          now. I don't care if it's after hours.

He hangs up, continues scrolling. A notification pops up on his screen: 
"Files Received." He opens them, his face illuminated by the changing 
light of the screen.

His expression shifts from confusion to concern to alarm.

                    CLAYTON
          What the hell?

He grabs a pen, jots down notes on a pad. We see phrases like "DOD 
allocation," "redirected funds," "classified project codes."

A KNOCK at the door startles him.

                    CLAYTON
          Come in.

His ASSISTANT (30s) enters with a folder.

                    ASSISTANT
          The files you requested, sir. Is 
          everything alright?

                    CLAYTON
                    (distracted)
          Fine. Thank you.

The assistant leaves. Clayton opens the folder, spreads physical documents 
across his desk. He compares them with what's on his screen, connecting 
dots.

He sits back in his chair, a realization dawning on him.

                    CLAYTON
                    (to himself)
          The green subsidies... they're not 
          from climate initiatives.

He picks up his phone again, hesitates, then dials.

                    CLAYTON
                    (into phone)
          I need to see you. Tomorrow morning. 
          It's about the funding discrepancies.

                    CLAYTON
                    (listens)
          No, this can't wait. My office, 8 AM.

He hangs up, stares at the documents spread before him.

CUT TO:

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Clayton paces nervously. The blinds are open, morning light streaming in. 
The documents from last night are neatly organized on his desk.

A KNOCK at the door.

                    CLAYTON
          Come in.

VARICK (60s), distinguished, silver-haired, in an expensive suit, enters. 
He carries himself with quiet authority.

                    VARICK
          Clayton. You sounded concerned on 
          the phone.

                    CLAYTON
          Please, sit down.

Varick sits across from Clayton's desk. Clayton remains standing.

                    CLAYTON
          I've been going over finances recently.

                    VARICK
          Have you?

                    CLAYTON
          Yes, one of my subordinates directed 
          my attention to what appears to be a 
          discrepancy in the green subsidies 
          filing.

                    VARICK
          The green subsidies filing, huh? Let 
          me get ahead of you on this one, 
          Clayton. If you're worried about 
          embezzlement--

                    CLAYTON
          No, no, that's not the case at all. 
          Besides, I have plenty of money.

                    CLAYTON
                    (beat)
          It's just, well, we traced some of 
          the funding from how it was earmarked 
          by the federal government and how it 
          reached our cash reserves.

                    VARICK
          OK.

                    CLAYTON
          And you see, not all of it is from 
          funding earmarked for climate 
          initiatives. In fact, and I'm not an 
          expert on interpreting these documents, 
          it seems a rather large portion of our 
          climate subsidies actually come from 
          the defense budget.

Varick studies Clayton's face, then leans back in his chair.

                    VARICK
          And why are you bringing this to me, 
          specifically?

                    CLAYTON
          For your advice.

Varick pauses, considering his response.

                    VARICK
          My advice is take the money.

                    CLAYTON
                    (surprised)
          What?

                    VARICK
          Look, you're getting the money to 
          fund your vision. The technicals of 
          getting that money from the public 
          to you are a little more complex than 
          you realize. Climate funding does not 
          go nearly as far as military funding.

Clayton sits down, processing this.

                    CLAYTON
          This is something you're concerned 
          with?

                    VARICK
          Yes, very.

                    CLAYTON
          Well, I wouldn't be--

                    VARICK
                    (interrupting)
          --Clayton, projects receive funding 
          under the table from the military all 
          the time. Your company wouldn't exist 
          if it weren't for the military. You 
          think Congress could pass a climate 
          spending bill for the amount of money 
          you've received?

                    CLAYTON
          But--

                    VARICK
          You want my advice? Take the money. 
          Who cares where it came from?

Clayton's expression hardens as realization dawns.

                    CLAYTON
          Where do you think that money comes 
          from?

Varick's expression shifts subtly, becoming colder.

                    VARICK
                    (after a pause)
          The accidents.

                    CLAYTON
          What's that?

                    VARICK
          The truth about where the company's 
          funding comes from.

Clayton stares at him, processing the implications.

                    CLAYTON
          But... those weren't accidents at all, 
          were they?

Varick stands, straightening his suit.

                    VARICK
          Oh, Clayton, do you even know how 
          your own invention works?

                    CLAYTON
          My engineers assured me--

                    VARICK
          --they told you what your security 
          clearance granted you, no more.

                    CLAYTON
          MY security clearance? I would think 
          I would know if one of my engineers 
          had a higher security clearance than 
          me. Everything in this company goes 
          through me!

Varick smiles coldly.

                    VARICK
          You look 5'11". Do you put 6 foot in 
          your dating profile?

Clayton stands, anger rising.

                    CLAYTON
          These are my inventions! For the good 
          of mankind!

                    VARICK
          You didn't invent them. And even if 
          you did, you don't own them. You don't 
          get to control what they're used for.

                    VARICK
                    (beat)
          The military paid for them. The 
          military owns them.

Clayton's face pales as the full reality hits him.

                    VARICK
          Let me spell this out for you: you 
          wanted to put autonomous vehicles on 
          every road in the United States. Did 
          you really think that wasn't a national 
          security concern?

                    CLAYTON
          You think I wanted to put autonomous 
          death machines on every road in the 
          United States?!

                    VARICK
          Maybe not. But that's what you did.

Long pause. Clayton looks like he's seen a ghost.

                    VARICK
          You better stop asking questions.

Varick walks to the door, stops, and turns back.

                    VARICK
          The Mammoth unveiling is in three 
          days. Make sure it goes smoothly. We 
          have plans for it.

He exits, leaving Clayton standing alone, shaken to his core.

Clayton slowly moves to his desk, collapses into his chair. He opens his 
drawer, pulls out a bottle of whiskey and a glass. His hands shake as he 
pours.

                    CLAYTON
                    (whispers)
          What have I done?

CUT TO BLACK.
