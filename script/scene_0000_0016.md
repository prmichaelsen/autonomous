INT. VIATECH HEADQUARTERS - MID-DAY

CLAYTON rushes into the office, past reception and through rows of employees 
frantically typing or on calls.

Some personnel, potentially a high ranking member of the company, chases 
down CLAYTON.

                    HIGH-RANKING EXECUTIVE
          Clayton!

He begins to speak, but CLAYTON's ears are ringing, all he hears is that 
ringing, his vision is blurry and out of focus. He strides through the 
office, walking past employee after employee rising from their desk to 
get his attention.

Finally he reaches a door and opens it.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

His private office, corner office, massive, luxury.

He slams it shut behind him and breathes a deep, nervous sigh of relief.

He looks up.

A FIGURE (VARICK) stands by the window, not facing CLAYTON.

                    FIGURE
          Close the blinds.
