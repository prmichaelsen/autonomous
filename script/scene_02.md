INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

The blinds are shut.

Silence pierces the stiff air.

Clayton is the first to speak.

                    CLAYTON
          Well?

                    DEX
          Sir, this is... this is just 
          impossible... this couldn't happen.

                    CLAYTON
          Evidently it is possible, Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          A man is splattered on the pavement 
          and headlines are splattered across 
          every major news site on the planet!

He pauses.

                    CLAYTON
                    (yelling)
          International! This is international 
          news! Do you know what this does to 
          our image? Our success?

                    DEX
          I don't--

                    CLAYTON
          You're lucky you didn't kill a 
          customer! FAITH is the key component 
          of our business. TRUST and SAFETY.

                    CLAYTON
          It only works if people BELIEVE it 
          is safe!

                    DEX
          I--

                    CLAYTON
          You're LUCKY the man who died was a 
          nobody. No one will miss him. No 
          lawsuits from a grieving family.

                    CLAYTON
          But we're still going to have the 
          DOJ up our ass, the FBI, the DOT, 
          all are going to be coming for blood, 
          you understand? To shut this company 
          down. Everything that I have built, 
          everything I have done, could go 
          down in flames! My blood! My sweat! 
          My credibility. My entire life.

                    CLAYTON
          Speak.

                    DEX
          I will look into it, sir. But I'm 
          telling you, this couldn't have been 
          our tech. I'm certain. Maybe if 
          something in QC went wrong--that's 
          the only failure point, QC. Human 
          error. A machine did not make this 
          mistake on its own. The tech is safe.

                    CLAYTON
          Listen carefully.

                    CLAYTON
          You're at my mercy right now. I 
          could have you disappear for this. 
          By not killing you right now, I'm 
          showing you mercy. I am showing you 
          my grace.

                    CLAYTON
          Are you grateful for my grace?

                    DEX
          Sir, I--

CLAYTON slams the desk and shouts at full volume, almost shrieking, almost 
like a frightened child, trying to project power, but deep in a tantrum. 
More begging than anything else, a self-assured man in the throes of 
instability.

                    CLAYTON
          TELL ME, YOU ARE GRATEFUL FOR MY 
          MERCY!

                    DEX
                    (quietly)
          I'm grateful...

                    CLAYTON
          For?

                    DEX
          Your mercy...

                    CLAYTON
          The man who died... who was he?

                    DEX
          No one. Which is who you will be if 
          you do not give me answers: how did 
          this happen?

                    DEX
          It can't. We have 10 million miles 
          driven with no incident, testing is 
          sound, QA left nothing unturned, 
          every edge case, every crash scenario, 
          we simulated everything. Our sensors 
          have 99.9 repeating to the 20th 
          decimal place precision. I can tell 
          you it was not a computer vision 
          issue. This was not an issue with 
          the technology, something happened 
          here.

                    CLAYTON
          Obviously there was an edge case, 
          Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          99.9 whatever percent is not 100.

                    CLAYTON
          That's how you failed.

                    DEX
          This technology has always had a 
          non-zero chance of failure, however 
          small, that non-zero chance is always 
          there. Never have I reported this 
          technology as 100% safe. I want that 
          to be clear. But 99.9 repeating to 
          the 20th decimal place is as good as 
          100%, six sigma is the standard, 
          that's 99.99966. But if you map our 
          data on a bell curve that includes 
          our success cases the sigma value is 
          theoretically infinite.

                    CLAYTON
          There's a non-zero chance you will 
          spend the rest of your life in a 
          federal prison, Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          What's the sigma on that?

                    CLAYTON
          How would you map that on a bell 
          curve?

dEX breathes a deep breath.

                    DEX
          Listen, I want us to take a clearer 
          view of the situation. You need to 
          think about this objectively. I'm 
          emotional, you're emotional, this is 
          not a time to be emotional. It's time 
          to account for all the possible ways 
          this scenario could play out.

                    DEX
          There's no legal precedent for this. 
          It could be a fine, they could go 
          after the engineering team, they 
          might go after the one who signed 
          off, sir.

                    CLAYTON
          If you have any ounce of 
          self-preservation, Dex, you'll find 
          out what went wrong, and who is 
          responsible. Right now it's on your 
          head unless you can prove that it's 
          not your fault. When they subpoena 
          the company, you're the one who will 
          be answering questions, not me.

                    CLAYTON
          I'm the face of this company, I'm 
          the visionary behind this company, 
          I'm an advocate for the future of 
          humanity, but engineering? That's on 
          you.

                    CLAYTON
          This company can survive without you, 
          it wouldn't exist without me.

                    CLAYTON
          Someone needs to be the face of this 
          failure.

                    CLAYTON
          And if you don't give me a definitive 
          answer of who or what was responsible 
          in the next 48 hours, then it's going 
          to be you.

Dex exits the office.
