INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

A spacious corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view of the city. Modern, minimalist furniture. Awards and accolades line the walls.

Clayton SLAMS the door shut behind him and Dex. He moves to the windows and closes the blinds, plunging the room into dim light.

Silence fills the room. Clayton stands with his back to Dex, collecting himself.

CLAYTON
Well?

Dex shifts uncomfortably, still processing what he's seen.

DEX
Sir, this is... this is just impossible... 
this couldn't happen.

Clayton turns around slowly, his face hardened.

CLAYTON
Evidently it is possible, Dex.

He moves to his desk, slams his fist down.

CLAYTON
A man is splattered on the pavement and 
headlines are splattered across every major 
news site on the planet!

(pause, then yelling)
International! This is international news! 
Do you know what this does to our image? 
Our success?

DEX
I don't--

CLAYTON
(cutting him off)
You're lucky you didn't kill a customer! 
FAITH is the key component of our business. 
TRUST and SAFETY.

Clayton paces, gesturing wildly.

CLAYTON
It only works if people BELIEVE it is safe!

DEX
I--

CLAYTON
You're LUCKY the man who died was a nobody. 
No one will miss him. No lawsuits from a 
grieving family.

Clayton stops pacing, his voice becoming more controlled but still intense.

CLAYTON
But we're still going to have the DOJ up our 
ass, the FCC, the DOT, all are going to be 
coming for blood, you understand? To shut 
this company down.

He leans over his desk, his knuckles white.

CLAYTON
Everything that I have built, everything I 
have done, could go down in flames! My blood! 
My sweat! My credibility. My entire life.

(beat)
Speak.

Dex takes a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure.

DEX
I will look into it, sir. But I'm telling you, 
this couldn't have been our tech. I'm certain. 
Maybe if something in QC went wrong--that's the 
only failure point, QC. Human error. A machine 
did not make this mistake on its own. The tech 
is safe.

Clayton approaches Dex slowly, his voice dropping to a threatening whisper.

CLAYTON
Listen carefully.

He gets uncomfortably close to Dex's face.

CLAYTON
You're at my mercy right now. I could have you 
disappear for this. By not killing you right now, 
I'm showing you mercy. I am showing you my grace.

(beat)
Are you grateful for my grace?

DEX
Sir, I--

Clayton SLAMS his desk and shouts at full volume, almost shrieking like a frightened child trying to project power.

CLAYTON
TELL ME, YOU ARE GRATEFUL FOR MY MERCY!

DEX
(quietly)
I'm grateful...

CLAYTON
For?

DEX
Your mercy...

Clayton backs off slightly, regaining some composure.

CLAYTON
The man who died... who was he?

DEX
No one. Which is who you will be if you do not 
give me answers: how did this happen?

DEX
It can't. We have 10 million miles driven with 
no incident, testing is sound, QA left nothing 
unturned, every edge case, every crash scenario, 
we simulated everything. Our sensors have 99.9 
repeating to the 20th decimal place precision. 
I can tell you it was not a computer vision issue. 
This was not an issue with the technology, 
something happened here.

CLAYTON
Obviously there was an edge case, Dex.

(beat)
99.9 whatever percent is not 100.

(beat)
That's how you failed.

DEX
This technology has always had a non-zero chance 
of failure, however small, that non-zero chance 
is always there. Never have I reported this 
technology as 100% safe. I want that to be clear. 
But 99.9 repeating to the 20th decimal place is 
as good as 100%, six sigma is the standard, that's 
99.99966. But if you map our data on a bell curve 
that includes our success cases the sigma value is 
theoretically infinite.

Clayton's eyes narrow.

CLAYTON
There's a non-zero chance you will spend the rest 
of your life in a federal prison, Dex.

(beat)
What's the sigma on that?

(beat)
How would you map that on a bell curve?

Dex takes a deep breath.

DEX
Listen, I want us to take a clearer view of the 
situation. You need to think about this objectively. 
I'm emotional, you're emotional, this is not a time 
to be emotional. It's time to account for all the 
possible ways this scenario could play out.

(beat)
There's no legal precedent for this. It could be a 
fine, they could go after the engineering team, they 
might go after the one who signed off, sir.

Clayton steps closer again, his voice cold and calculating.

CLAYTON
If you have any ounce of self-preservation, Dex, 
you'll find out what went wrong, and who is responsible. 
Right now it's on your head unless you can prove that 
it's not your fault. When they subpoena the company, 
you're the one who will be answering questions, not me.

Clayton walks to the window, parts the blinds slightly to look out.

CLAYTON
I'm the face of this company, I'm the visionary 
behind this company, I'm an advocate for the future 
of humanity, but engineering? That's on you.

(beat)
This company can survive without you, it wouldn't 
exist without me.

He turns back to face Dex.

CLAYTON
Someone needs to be the face of this failure.

(beat)
And if you don't give me a definitive answer of 
who or what was responsible in the next 48 hours, 
then it's going to be you.

Dex stands there, absorbing the threat. Clayton gestures dismissively toward the door.

CLAYTON
Get out. And fix this.

Dex nods stiffly and exits the office. As the door closes behind him, Clayton collapses into his chair, the facade of strength crumbling. He puts his head in his hands, a man feeling the weight of his empire beginning to crumble.

CUT TO:

INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - OUTSIDE CLAYTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Dex steps out to face several ENGINEERS gathered outside Clayton's door. They look at him expectantly.

ENGINEER #1
What did he say?

DEX
He's a little upset.

(beat)
How do you feel about sleeping in the office tonight?

ENGINEER #2
Judging by what I heard from that conversation, 
I don't think any of us are sleeping tonight.

DEX
Yeah, I probably couldn't sleep if I wanted to.

(beat)
Unless you're interested in taking the fall for me?

ENGINEER #2
Well, let's just say it's a good thing he's coming 
after you, and not me.

DEX
And why's that?

ENGINEER #2
Because I sure as fuck don't want to be in the hotseat.

Dex looks back at Clayton's closed door, his mind already racing through possibilities.

DEX
(quietly, to himself)
This shouldn't have happened. It couldn't have happened.

(beat)
Unless...

CUT TO BLACK.
