INT. RAVEL'S HOME - NIGHT

A dimly lit living room. Sparse furniture, minimalist decor. The home of 
a man who barely lives there. A wall with framed photos - most featuring 
a smiling young girl with butterfly clips in her hair.

Dex sits cautiously on the edge of a worn couch, still processing the 
events in the woods. His hands are no longer cuffed, but he remains tense, 
ready to move if needed.

Ravel enters from another room carrying a laptop and a box of files. He 
places them on the coffee table between them.

                    RAVEL
          I've been collecting evidence for months.

He opens the laptop, types briefly. Turns it to face Dex.

ON SCREEN: Police report for Senator Harmon's death. Cause listed as 
"single vehicle accident, driver impairment suspected."

                    RAVEL
          This was Senator Harmon's "accident." 
          Official report said he was drunk. He 
          wasn't. He chaired a committee investigating 
          accidents involving Aivia Ghosts.

Ravel scrolls to another document.

ON SCREEN: Another police report, this one for a pedestrian fatality.

                    RAVEL
          Advocate for laws against self-driving cars. 
          Three weeks before she was scheduled to testify 
          against Viatech.

Dex leans forward, studying the reports intently.

                    DEX
          These aren't glitches. The vehicles are 
          being controlled.

                    RAVEL
          Exactly. And this last one...

Ravel pulls up another file on the laptop.

                    RAVEL
          Mina Canario.

Dex's eyes widen in recognition.

                    DEX
          Mina... she died in an accident... her car 
          tumbled off a cliff.

                    RAVEL
          No. Not an accident.

                    RAVEL (cont)
          I was first responder to her crash. Officially 
          the report was a hit and run. Aivia was 
          missing from the report. I was supposed to 
          collect the evidence, file the dashcam footage. 
          But instead. I didn't file it. I took it home.

Without another word, Ravel clicks play on a video file.

ON SCREEN: Dashcam footage from inside Mina's car. An Aivia Ghost appears 
behind her vehicle, then pulls alongside. Suddenly it swerves, pinning her 
car against a guardrail on a cliffside road. The Ghost repeatedly rams her 
vehicle until it breaks through the guardrail and plummets off the cliff.

Dex watches in horror, his face pale.

                    RAVEL
          I know I shouldn't have, but I had this 
          sinking feeling. Two days later, I went 
          to her apartment. It was locked so I 
          busted it down. Her apartment was cleared 
          out, like she never existed.

Dex flips through the file, stops at a photo of Mina with Clayton at a 
company event.

                    DEX
          I knew her. Not well, but... she was 
          brilliant. Quiet.


Ravel reaches into his pocket, pulls out a small flash drive.

He hands the flash drive to Dex.

                    RAVEL
          Everything I know about the incidents is 
          on there. All the footage, reports, everything.

Dex examines the flash drive, turning it over in his hands.

A heavy silence falls between them. Ravel stands, walks to the window, 
peers through the blinds.

                    RAVEL
          They'll be looking for you. For both of 
          us now.

He hesitates, then:

                    RAVEL
          There's more. The police force purchased an entire fleet.
          Aivia Ghosts. Testing them silently as 
          surveillance vehicles. They're everywhere 
          now. Eyes and ears on every street. Mass surveillance.

                    DEX
          Why are you helping me?

Ravel turns, his face half in shadow.

                    RAVEL
          Because I couldn't save my daughter. 
          But maybe we can save someone else's.

He walks back to Dex, looks firmly into his eyes.

                    RAVEL
          Make this right.

Dex nods, pocketing the flash drive.

                    DEX
          I will.

                    RAVEL
          There's a back door. Take the path through 
          the woods. Stay off the main roads.

Dex stands, hesitates.

                    DEX
          Thank you.

                    RAVEL
          Don't thank me. Just make it right. For Emma.

Dex nods, moves toward the back door. Ravel watches him go, then turns 
back to the wall of photos, his daughter's smile frozen in time.
