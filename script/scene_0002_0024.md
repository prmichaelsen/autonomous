INT. RAVEL'S HOME - NIGHT

Dex watches in horror, his face pale.

                    RAVEL
          I know I shouldn't have, but I had this 
          sinking feeling. Two days later, I went 
          to her apartment. It was locked so I 
          busted it down. Her apartment was cleared 
          out, like she never existed.

Dex flips through the file, stops at a photo of Mina with Clayton at a 
company event.

                    DEX
          I knew her. Not well, but... she was 
          brilliant. Quiet.

Ravel reaches into his pocket, pulls out a small flash drive.

He hands the flash drive to Dex.

                    RAVEL
          Everything I know about the incidents is 
          on there. All the footage, reports, everything.

Dex examines the flash drive, turning it over in his hands.

A heavy silence falls between them. Ravel stands, walks to the window, 
peers through the blinds.

                    RAVEL
          They'll be looking for you. For both of 
          us now.

He hesitates, then:

                    RAVEL
          There's more. The police force purchased an entire fleet.
          Aivia Ghosts. Testing them silently as 
          surveillance vehicles. They're everywhere 
          now. Eyes and ears on every street. Mass surveillance.

                    DEX
          Why are you helping me?

Ravel turns, his face half in shadow.

                    RAVEL
          Because I couldn't save my daughter. 
          But maybe we can save someone else's.

                    DEX
          Do you think your daughter was a target?

                    RAVEL
          No.

He walks back to Dex, looks firmly into his eyes.

                    RAVEL
          I think that was your fault.

                    RAVEL
          Make this right.

Dex nods, pocketing the flash drive.

                    DEX
          I will.

                    RAVEL
          There's a back door. Take the path through 
          the woods. Stay off the main roads.

Dex stands, hesitates.

                    DEX
          Thank you.

                    RAVEL
          Don't thank me. Just make it right. For Emma.

Dex nods, moves toward the back door. Ravel watches him go, then turns 
back to the wall of photos, his daughter's smile frozen in time.
