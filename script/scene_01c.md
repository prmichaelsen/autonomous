INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

DEXTON "DEX" SHARP (30s), an engineer, sits at his desk, staring in 
horror at his computer screen. News footage of the accident plays, 
showing the BEGGAR's body being covered with a sheet.

          This is impossible...

XCU DEX's face

                    REPORTER (background)
          Reporting at the scene of a horrific 
          accident here at the intersection of 
          5th Ave and 7th St in Downtown, as a 
          man was hit by one of Viatech's 'Aivia 
          Ghosts', a self-driving vehicle that 
          drivers have come to know as a safer, 
          faster, and more convenient alternative 
          to other modes of transportation. This 
          accident is the first of its kind, 
          after Aivia Ghosts have been on the 
          road for at least 14 months since their 
          initial public launch. The accident 
          comes mere days before Viatech's 
          unveiling of the 'Aivia Mammoth', a 
          self-driving semi-truck that promises 
          to revolutionize the supply chain 
          industry...

DEX's face is drenched in sweat, his hands trembling. The world around 
him seems to fade away as the reporter's voice becomes distant, 
replaced by a high-pitched ringing.

                    CLAYTON (O.S.)
          Dex.

DEX wheels around in panic. CLAYTON stands there, disheveled, his eyes 
wild.

                    CLAYTON
          We need to talk.

CUT TO BLACK.
