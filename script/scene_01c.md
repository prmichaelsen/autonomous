INT. VIATECH HEADQUARTERS - OUTSIDE CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MID-DAY

The blinds of the office close shut.

The chaos, rabble, and noise of the office fills the scene.  One engineer 
sits at his desk: DEXTON SHARP. His eyes are glued to his screen.
His hand covers half his face. He watches on in abject horror, terror, 
and guilt as the scene flashes across his monitor.

Through his headphones we hear:

                    REPORTER (V.O.)
          Reporting at the scene of a horrific 
          accident here at the intersection of 
          5th Ave and 7th St in Downtown, as a 
          man was hit by one of Viatech's 'Aivia 
          Ghosts', a self driving vehicle that 
          drivers have come to know as a safer, 
          faster, and more convenient alternative 
          to other modes of transportation. This 
          accident is the first of its kind, 
          after Aivia Ghost's have been on the 
          road for at least 14 months since it's 
          initial public launch. The accident 
          comes mere days before Viatech's 
          unveiling of the 'Aivia Mammoth', a 
          self driving semi-truck that promises 
          to revolutionize the supply chain 
          industry. Questions will arise as to 
          how this happened, how safe the Aivia 
          Ghost truly is, and whoâ€”is accountable. 
          Signing off for Channel 10 news...

CU DEX's face, framed from shoulders upwards, his dress shirt is steeped 
in sweat, his hands nervously tap his desk. The camera pans closer and 
closer to his flustered face, which is filled with a dreadful fear. His 
heart is pulsing, and we hear it getting louder and louder as the reporting 
continues and as we continue to zoom closer into a XCU of his eyes. The 
world around him grows in distance in a Hitchcock shot. White noise and 
ringing slowly overtake the reporting, as DEX wipes sweat from his face.

                    CLAYTON (O.S.)
          Dex.

DEX wheels his head around in a panic. His eyes meet CLAYTON's.

                    CLAYTON
          We need to talk.
