INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - TECHNICAL LAB - NIGHT

The office is mostly empty, lights off. Only a few workstations are 
occupied. DEX sits at his desk, surrounded by multiple screens. The only 
light comes from the monitors, casting a blue glow on his exhausted face. 
Empty coffee cups litter the desk.

Across the room, DMITRI works silently at his station. A FEW OTHER ENGINEERS 
are scattered throughout the large space, all focused on their own tasks.

He's reviewing data logs from the accident, scrolling through lines of 
code and vehicle telemetry.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: Vehicle diagnostic data showing normal operations, then 
a sudden override command followed by acceleration.

                    DEX
                    (to himself)
          This doesn't make sense...

He pulls up another screen showing a database of all Aivia test vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: A spreadsheet with hundreds of entries. Many have 
location data, but over 100 entries show "LOCATION DATA UNAVAILABLE" or 
"ACCESS RESTRICTED."

DEX narrows his eyes, types rapidly.

                    DEX
          Computer, show me all vehicles with 
          restricted location data for the past 
          six months.

DMITRI eyes DEX. The computer processes. A new screen appears showing a timeline with 
clusters of vehicles going dark at specific dates.

DEX leans forward, puzzled.

                    DEX
          That's weird... over a hundred vehicles 
          unaccounted for.

He tries another command.

                    DEX
          Show deployment locations for restricted 
          vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: "ACCESS DENIED - SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED"

                    DEX
          What the hell?

He quickly downloads the vehicle inventory data to a secure drive.

Through the window, the first light of dawn begins to break. DEX glances 
over at DMITRI, who's still working diligently.

                    DEX
          Another all-nighter, Dmitri? You know what 
          they say about all work and no play...

                    DMITRI
                    (without looking up)
          It keeps you out of federal prison?

                    DEX
          Well, I think I found something interesting.
          There's over 100 Ghosts that aren't accounted for.

                    DMITRI
          That is... interesting.

DEX turns back to his screen and continues working.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

CLAYTON sits behind his desk, reviewing the data DEX has presented. His 
expression darkens with each slide.

                    CLAYTON
                    (seething)
          I want to congratulate you on finding me nothing.

                    DEX
          Over a hundred of them, Clayton. With 
          restricted access that even I can't get into. 
          Why would our own vehicles be classified?

                    DEX
          And there's more. I've been looking at the 
          financial records too. The funding doesn't 
          add up. I can't account for where all the 
          money for this project is coming from. The 
          climate initiative grants only cover about 
          60% of our operational costs.

CLAYTON SLAMS his fist on the desk, stands abruptly.

                    CLAYTON
          You're an engineer.
          Find the engineering faults.

                    DEX
                    (exhausted but determined)
          I'm just showing you what I found, Clayton.
          I can't explain it, but something's not right.

                    CLAYTON
          I gave you 24 hours. I was very clear about 
          what would happen if you didn't deliver.

                    CLAYTON (cont)
          Time's up, Dex.

                    DEX
          For God's sake, Clayton! I'm trying to protect 
          the company! Don't you want to know why our 
          own vehicles are being hidden from us?

CLAYTON's expression shifts from anger to cold calculation. He moves toward the window.

Blue and red lights begin to flash through the glass, illuminating the room in pulses.

                    CLAYTON
          Time's up, Dex.

DEX stares at him, realization dawning as the police lights fill the room.

The office door opens. Two FBI AGENTS in suits enter, followed by 
more agents. Everything seems to slow down for Dex. Sound fades 
away.

                    AGENT #1 (inaudible)
          Dexton Sharp?

DEX turns. 

                    DEX (inaudible)
          Yes?

                    AGENT #1 (inaudible)
          We'd like you to come with us. We have a few
          questions.

SLOW MOTION: The agents approach, their movements fluid yet deliberate. 
Sound becomes muffled, distant. One agent pulls out handcuffs that glint 
in the office light.

DEX watches, almost detached, as they grab his arms. The cold metal of 
handcuffs clicks around his wrists.

                    CLAYTON (V.O)
          You know what happens now, Dex? You disappear. 
          You'll spend the rest of your life in a cell. 
          No one will remember your name. Your family 
          will never know what happened to you. Just 
          another brilliant mind... gone.

                    DEX (V.O)
          I didn't do this! You know I didn't do this!

                    CLAYTON (V.O)
          No, Dex. You did.
