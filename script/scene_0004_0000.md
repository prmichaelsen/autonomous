INT. VIATECH MILITARY DIVISION - VARICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A cavernous office with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view 
of dense forest. The facility is hidden deep in the woods, away from prying 
eyes. Military memorabilia and service medals in display cases line one wall. 
A massive desk dominates the space.

DEAN VARICK (60s, tall, imposing, military bearing) stands with his back to 
the door, looking out at the moonlit forest. His silver crew cut catches the light.

A hesitant KNOCK at the door.

                    VARICK
                    (without turning)
          Enter.

The door opens slowly. CLAYTON STANFORD enters, his sickly pallor even more 
pronounced in the dim light, beady eyes darting around the room. His thin lips 
quiver with fear as he clutches a tablet to his chest like a shield. His hands 
tremble slightly, long bony fingers gripping the device.

                    VARICK
          Clayton.

Clayton swallows hard, takes a small step forward.

Varick turns slowly, his weathered face impassive. He gestures to a chair 
across from his desk.

                    VARICK
          Please, sit.

Clayton hesitates, then moves to the chair. He sits on the edge, back straight, 
tense. VARICK sits in his desk chair.

                    VARICK
          You've been on the news a lot lately.

Clayton places the tablet on Varick's desk with shaking hands, turns it to face 
him. On screen: financial reports with highlighted discrepancies.

                    CLAYTON
                    (choosing words carefully)
          One of my subordinates was reviewing our records
          on the deployment of our vehicles. He 
          noticed some... discrepancies. Vehicles missing 
          from our inventory. Ghosts that were manufactured 
          but no records on their location.

Varick glances at the tablet, his expression unchanged.

                    VARICK
          Dexton Sharp?

Silence, Clayton nods slightly.

                    VARICK
          You trust Dexton Sharp?

                    CLAYTON
          These aren't accounting errors. These vehicles 
          exist, but they're not where they're supposed 
          to be. And there's more.

He swipes to another document, his finger trembling.

                    CLAYTON
          Our funding. The climate initiative subsidies. 
          They're not coming from where we thought. They're 
          being routed through shell companies.

                    VARICK
          You've been busy.

Clayton's eyes drop to the floor momentarily.

                    CLAYTON
          I want the truth.

                    VARICK
          What's that?

                    CLAYTON
          The truth about where.... the truth about where the company's funding comes from.

Varick rises from his chair. Clayton instinctively leans back, creating distance.

                    VARICK

He steps closer to Clayton, who presses himself back into the chair.

                    VARICK
          What did you think all these government subsidies were? 
          A climate project? This is the real world, Clayton.

                    CLAYTON (coming to a realization)
          The funding is military.

Clayton's face pales further, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

                    VARICK
          You've created an unprecedented opportunity.

                    CLAYTON
          Opportunity? These, these vehicles... they're meant 
          to save lives not take them! They're--they're--
          they're meant to improve the world not destroy it!

                    CLAYTON
                    (horrified realization)
          That man... outside headquarters...

                    VARICK
          Clayton, radar was a military project, the internet 
          was a military project... major advancements are 
          funded for war. Because of war. You had to have 
          known that this technology would be used this way 
          eventually.

                    CLAYTON
          Reprehensible.
          
                    VARICK
now theres a way to talk. don't forget it's your invention that's been doing the killing. and it's been you doing the cover ups. you were even present for one of the accidents, i recall? i read all the reports. and we have the onboard footage. 

                    CLAYTON
          You're blackmailing me?

                    VARICK
          No, I'm doing you a favor. Look the other way. 
          You've never had a problem with that before.

Clayton stares, speechless.

                    VARICK
          Measure your next words carefully, Clayton.

Clayton's mouth opens, then closes. He looks down, then up again, summoning 
what little courage he has left.

                    CLAYTON
                    (barely audible)
          I can't be part of this.

Varick's expression hardens.

                    VARICK
          You don't have a choice.

He presses a button on his desk. The door opens. Two SECURITY GUARDS enter.
Clayton jumps at the sound, turning to look at the guards with wide eyes.

                    VARICK
          You're going to go home. You're going to forget 
          this conversation. And you're going to continue 
          being the face of Aivia.

                    CLAYTON
                    (voice trembling)
          And if I don't?

Varick stands, walks around the desk. Clayton shrinks back as Varick places 
a hand on his shoulder, squeezing hard enough to make Clayton wince.

                    VARICK
                    (quietly, menacingly)
          Then you might have an unfortunate accident. 
          They happen every day.

He nods to the guards.

                    VARICK
          Escort Mr. Stanford to his car.

The guards move to Clayton's sides. Clayton rises shakily from his chair, 
his legs unsteady.

                    CLAYTON
                    (weakly)
          I can find my own way.

                    VARICK
          That wasn't a suggestion.

Clayton nods submissively, head down. The guards flank him as he walks to 
the door with unsteady steps. At the threshold, he pauses, gathering himself 
for one last moment of defiance. He turns, opens his mouth to speak, but 
meets Varick's cold stare and thinks better of it.

                    VARICK
          Clayton.

Clayton stops, turns back.

                    VARICK
          Don't do anything rash. I can only protect you so much.

Clayton exits, the guards following. Varick returns to the window, looking 
out at the dark forest.

The guards escort Clayton into his own vehicle--an Aivia Ghost.

FADE TO BLACK.
