INT. UNMARKED POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Dex sits in the back, separated by a cage. Ravel drives in complete silence, 
eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, never looking back. The tension is palpable.

The city lights fade behind them as Ravel takes an exit, then another. 
The roads become narrower, less traveled. Dex shifts uncomfortably but 
remains silent.

Ravel drives onto a dirt road. 
He begins to speak, his voice quiet at first, eyes fixed straight ahead, 
never looking back at Dex.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          Her name was Emma. Eight years old.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She loved butterflies. Had this collection 
          of them on her wall. Drew them everywhere.

His voice grows softer, more distant. Tears begin to well in his eyes, 
but his gaze remains locked on the road ahead.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She wanted to be a scientist. Study 
          insects. So smart. So damn smart.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          Every night, she'd tell me about some 
          new fact she learned. Did you know 
          butterflies taste with their feet? 
          She told me that.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          She was in our front yard. Playing. 
          There was this butterfly... blue one. 
          She... she chased it into the street.

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I saw it happen. She ran into the street... 
          right in front of the car. It should have 
          stopped. It should have seen her. Why didn't
          it see her?

                    AGENT RAVEL
          I ran to her. Held her in my arms. So 
          small. So... broken.

His knuckles turn white on the steering wheel.

                    AGENT RAVEL
                    (whispers to himself)
          She just loved butterflies.

Suddenly, he makes a hard turn off the road. The cruiser lurches as it 
leaves the gravel road, bouncing violently over rough terrain. Dex is thrown 
against the cage as they crash through underbrush.
