EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

The glass doors of the building open. Dex is led out in handcuffs by the 
FBI agents. A CROWD has gathered - PROTESTERS with signs reading "KILLER 
CARS" and "AI KILLS," NEWS CREWS with cameras rolling, REPORTERS shouting 
questions.

CAMERA FLASHES blind Dex momentarily. Microphones are thrust in his face.

Dex is pushed toward an unmarked FBI vehicle. Through the crowd, he spots 
Clayton watching from the building entrance, flanked by DMITRI.

Dex's face is a mask of somber realizations. He makes direct eye contact 
with Clayton across the crowd - a silent, powerful accusation. Clayton 
looks away first.

An FBI AGENT silently hands Dex over to AGENT RAVEL (40s, crew cut, 
weathered face, rigid posture). Ravel's eyes are hard, his jaw clenched 
tight as he stares at Dex. Ravel forces DEX's head down and into
an unmarked cruiser.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Clayton watches from his window as the FBI car drives away. His confident 
facade cracks slightly. He is thinking to himself, but says nothing. The seed of
doubt has been planted in his mind. He thinks for a long time.

Clayton turns to DMITRI DVULIKIY, his right-hand man who has been standing 
silently in the corner.

                    CLAYTON
                    (turning to Dmitri)
          What was Dex's clearance level?

                    DMITRI
          Secret.

                    CLAYTON
          And what's yours?

                    DMITRI
          Top secret, sir.

                    CLAYTON
          I need you to look into something for me.

Wide shot of the chaos. They continue their conversation, inaudibly.
DMITRI enters the building.

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Clayton emerges from the building to face the press.

                    REPORTER #1
          Mr. Stanford, what can you tell us about 
          the accusations against Dexton Sharp?

                    CLAYTON
          Aivia has always prioritized safety and 
          transparency. We are cooperating 
          full with authorities.

                    REPORTER #2
          Is it true that Mr. Sharp was responsible 
          for the accident that killed a child?

                    CLAYTON
          I can't comment on an ongoing investigation, 
          but I can assure you that Aivia's autonomous 
          vehicles remain the safest in the industry.

Clayton's phone RINGS. He checks it, his expression shifting subtly.

                    CLAYTON
          I apologize, but I need to take this. My team 
          will provide you with our official statement.

He steps away from the reporters, moving toward a sleek black car waiting 
at the curb. As he opens the door, we see his face harden with determination.

                    CLAYTON
                    (into phone)
          I'm on my way.

DMITRI, watching from the building steps, steps back into 
the shadows and watches CLAYTON leave.
