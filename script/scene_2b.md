INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - TECHNICAL LAB - NIGHT

Dex sits alone in the dimly lit lab, surrounded by multiple screens. The 
only light comes from the monitors, casting a blue glow on his exhausted 
face. Empty coffee cups litter the desk.

He's reviewing data logs from the accident, scrolling through lines of 
code and vehicle telemetry.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: Vehicle diagnostic data showing normal operations, then 
a sudden override command followed by acceleration.

                    DEX
                    (to himself)
          This doesn't make sense...

He pulls up another screen showing a database of all Aivia test vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: A spreadsheet with hundreds of entries. Many have 
location data, but over 100 entries show "LOCATION DATA UNAVAILABLE" or 
"ACCESS RESTRICTED."

Dex narrows his eyes, types rapidly.

                    DEX
          Computer, show me all vehicles with 
          restricted location data for the past 
          six months.

The computer processes. A new screen appears showing a timeline with 
clusters of vehicles going dark at specific dates.

Dex leans forward, noticing a pattern.

                    DEX
          Cross-reference with reported incidents 
          involving public figures or government 
          officials.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: News headlines appear next to vehicle data points:
"ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST DIES IN CAR CRASH"
"WHISTLEBLOWER KILLED IN HIGHWAY ACCIDENT"
"SENATOR CRITICAL OF MILITARY SPENDING DIES IN COLLISION"

Dex's eyes widen. He sits back in his chair, running his hands through 
his hair.

                    DEX
          Jesus Christ...

He quickly downloads the data to a secure drive, looking nervously over 
his shoulder.

The lab door OPENS. Dex quickly switches screens. A SECURITY GUARD peers in.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Mr. Sharp? Still here? Building's 
          closing down for the night.

                    DEX
                    (casual)
          Just finishing up. Clayton wants this 
          analysis by morning.

The guard nods, leaves. Dex waits until the footsteps fade, then ejects 
the drive and pockets it.

He pulls out his phone, hesitates, then dials.

                    DEX
          Clayton? We need to talk. There's 
          something you need to see.

CUT TO:

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Clayton sits behind his desk, reviewing the data Dex has presented. His 
expression darkens with each slide.

                    CLAYTON
          This is what you dragged me in here for?
          Conspiracy theories?

                    DEX
          The pattern is undeniable. And there's 
          more. I found financial discrepancies 
          too. Money coming in that doesn't match 
          our reported investors.

Clayton SLAMS his fist on the desk, stands abruptly.

                    CLAYTON
          Do you have ANY idea what you're implying?
          That MY company is involved in some kind 
          of... what? Assassination program?

                    DEX
          I'm just showing you the data, Clayton. 
          Something's not right here.

Clayton walks around the desk, gets in Dex's face.

                    CLAYTON
          You were supposed to find me a scapegoat 
          for the accident. Someone to take the fall. 
          Instead, you waste my time with this 
          paranoid GARBAGE!

                    DEX
          People are dying, Clayton! Real people!

Clayton's expression shifts from anger to cold calculation.

                    CLAYTON
          You know what? I've made a decision.

He walks back behind his desk, sits down.

                    CLAYTON
          I've found my fall guy.

Dex stares at him, realization dawning.

                    DEX
          Clayton, don't do this.

                    CLAYTON
          You had 48 hours to find someone to blame. 
          Time's up. Congratulations, Dex. You're 
          now responsible for the accident.

                    DEX
          You can't be serious.

                    CLAYTON
          I've already contacted the authorities. 
          Don't bother clearing your desk. And Dex? 
          If you somehow wiggle out of this, I'll 
          make sure you never work in tech again.

The office door BURSTS open. Two FBI AGENTS in suits enter, followed by 
more agents. Everything seems to slow down for Dex.

SLOW MOTION: The agents approach, their movements fluid yet deliberate. 
Sound becomes muffled, distant. One agent pulls out handcuffs that glint 
in the office light.

Dex watches, almost detached, as they grab his arms. The cold metal of 
handcuffs clicks around his wrists.

                    CLAYTON
          All I know is you failed this company. 
          And now you're trying to cover it up with 
          wild accusations.

As the agents pull Dex toward the door, time seems to stretch. He locks 
eyes with Clayton - a moment of silent confrontation. Dex's gaze is 
unwavering, accusing. Clayton's expression flickers with something - 
doubt? Fear? - before he breaks eye contact first, looking away.

                    CLAYTON
          No, Dex. You did.

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

The glass doors of the building open. Dex is led out in handcuffs by the 
FBI agents. A CROWD has gathered - PROTESTERS with signs reading "KILLER 
CARS" and "AI KILLS," NEWS CREWS with cameras rolling, REPORTERS shouting 
questions.

CAMERA FLASHES blind Dex momentarily. Microphones are thrust in his face.

                    REPORTER #1
          Mr. Sharp! Did you deliberately disable 
          the safety protocols?

                    REPORTER #2
          Was this corporate sabotage?

Dex is pushed toward a waiting FBI vehicle. Through the crowd, he spots 
Clayton watching from the building entrance, flanked by PR PEOPLE.

Dex's face is a mask of stoic determination. He makes direct eye contact 
with Clayton across the crowd - a silent, powerful accusation. Clayton 
looks away first.

The FBI agents shove Dex into the back of the vehicle. As the door closes, 
we see Dex's expression: resolute, somber, calculating.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Clayton watches from his window as the FBI car drives away. His confident 
facade cracks slightly. He picks up his phone, dials.

                    CLAYTON
          It's me. We have a problem.

MATCH CUT TO SCENE 3
