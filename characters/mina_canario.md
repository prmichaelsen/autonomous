## BACKGROUND
Mina Canario was a talented engineer at Aivia/Viatech who specialized in safety systems for autonomous vehicles. During her work, she noticed anomalies in accident reports and system logs that suggested the vehicles were being remotely controlled in certain instances. As she dug deeper, she discovered evidence that the autonomous vehicles were being used for targeted assassinations.

When she tried to report her findings internally, her concerns were dismissed. When she persisted, she was fired or forced to resign. She then attempted to gather evidence and warn others, including possibly trying to reach Clayton directly.

Before she could expose the truth, she was killed in what was made to look like an accident involving an autonomous vehicle - becoming one of the very victims of the system she was trying to expose.

## MOTIVATIONS
- Protecting the public from dangerous technology
- Exposing the truth about the autonomous vehicles
- Holding those responsible accountable
- Preventing further assassinations

## SIGNIFICANCE TO THE STORY
Though deceased before the main story begins, Mina Canario's actions and death serve several important purposes:

1. **Foreshadowing:** Her death hints at the conspiracy before it's fully revealed
2. **Motivation:** Her work may provide clues that help Dex in his investigation
3. **Thematic Resonance:** Her name "Canario" (Canary) references the "canary in the coal mine" - the first warning of danger
4. **Emotional Weight:** Her fate adds emotional stakes to Dex's journey

## POSSIBLE APPEARANCES
Though deceased, Mina could appear in the story through:
- Flashbacks showing her discovery and attempts to warn others
- Video recordings she left behind
- Documentation and evidence she gathered
- Stories told by others who knew her

## FINAL THOUGHTS
Mina Canario represents the ethical technologist who recognizes the dangers of her work and takes responsibility for it. Her name symbolically ties to her role as the first warning sign (like a canary in a coal mine) of the deadly conspiracy. Though she dies before she can fully expose the truth, her efforts are not in vain if they eventually help Dex uncover and stop the misuse of the technology she helped create.
