## BACKGROUND
Dexton Sharp is a highly skilled engineer at Aivia who worked on the autonomous vehicle technology. He believed in the safety and reliability of the system, citing its impressive statistical safety record. When the beggar is killed, he's initially convinced it must be an anomaly or human error, not a failure of the technology itself. As he investigates under pressure from Clayton, he begins to uncover the truth.

## MOTIVATIONS
- Initially: Professional pride, job security, proving the technology isn't at fault
- Later: Exposing the truth, stopping the misuse of the technology, justice for those killed

## INTERNAL CONFLICTS
- Professional loyalty vs. Moral responsibility
- Self-preservation vs. Doing what's right
- Faith in technology vs. Recognition of its dangers

## SKILLS & ABILITIES
- Deep technical knowledge of autonomous vehicle systems
- Problem-solving and analytical thinking
- Ability to use the backdoor in the system (learned from the ex-engineer)
- Resourcefulness under pressure

## FINAL THOUGHTS
Dexton Sharp represents the ethical engineer who must confront the unintended consequences of technology. His journey from company loyalist to whistleblower and hero shows the importance of individual moral courage in the face of corporate and military power. His mixed feelings about Clayton at the end suggest a nuanced understanding of responsibility - recognizing that good intentions don't excuse harmful outcomes, but also that systems of power often corrupt and co-opt well-meaning innovations.
