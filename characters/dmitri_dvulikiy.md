- **Position:** Clayton Stanford's right-hand person at Aivia (public role)
- **True Role:** Varick's second-in-command and primary operative

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW

Dmitri Dvulikiy is Clayton Stanford's right-hand person at Aivia, appearing to be a loyal sycophant who anticipates Clayton's needs and supports his vision. However, this is merely a facade. In reality, Dmitri is secretly working for Varick as "Number Two" in his organization, programming the backdoor into Aivia's autonomous vehicles that allows for remote control and is personally responsible for orchestrating all the assassinations.

## CHARACTER TRAITS

- **Public Persona**: Deferential, efficient, detail-oriented, always agreeable to Clayton
- **Private Reality**: Calculating, ruthless, technically brilliant, morally compromised
- **Emotional Capacity**: Complete lack of empathy; views people as tools or obstacles
- **Motivation**: Ideological alignment with Varick and his military objectives
- **Technical Expertise**: Elite-level programming skills, particularly in AI systems and remote access protocols
- **Psychological Profile**: Total sociopathy, able to compartmentalize actions, presents a completely different face to the world than his true self
- **Loyalty**: Absolute loyalty to Varick, while maintaining a convincing facade of devotion to Clayton

## DUAL ROLES

### As Clayton's Assistant
- Appears to be Clayton's most trusted advisor
- Manages Clayton's schedule and priorities
- Presents as indispensable to Aivia's operations
- Maintains access to all of Clayton's confidential information

### As Varick's "Number Two"
- Secretly implemented the backdoor in Aivia's autonomous vehicle system
- Personally selects targets and executes assassinations via remote control
- Reports directly to Varick while maintaining cover as Clayton's loyal employee
- May be responsible for framing Dex when things start to unravel
- Serves as Varick's eyes and ears within Aivia

## BACKGROUND

Dmitri was strategically placed within Aivia by Varick to ensure military control over the autonomous vehicle technology. His technical brilliance made him the perfect candidate to implement the backdoor system while rising through the ranks to become Clayton's trusted right hand. His position gives him unprecedented access to both the technical systems and the company's leadership decisions.

## KEY RELATIONSHIPS

- **With Clayton**: Presents as loyal and indispensable while secretly betraying him
- **With Varick**: True loyalty lies here; serves as Varick's primary operative
- **With Dex**: Professional rivalry possibly masking a deeper personal connection or history
- **With Military/Government**: Likely has his own connections independent of Varick

## MOTIVATIONS
- Ideological alignment with Varick's vision and military objectives
- Serving Varick's agenda with unwavering loyalty
- Power and control
- Expression of his sociopathic nature through technological manipulation

## KEY MOMENTS
- Implementing the backdoor in Aivia's systems
- Remotely executing assassinations
- Warning Varick about Clayton's suspicions
- Potential confrontation with Dex when his true role is discovered

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

- Consider making Dmitri someone who initially believed in Clayton's vision but was corrupted/turned by Varick
- Potential for a scene where Dmitri is shown remotely executing an assassination, revealing his direct involvement
- Could have subtle hints throughout early scenes (unusual access to systems, unexplained absences, private calls)
- Might have personal connection to Dex that makes the betrayal more impactful
- His Russian background could be explored - perhaps he has ties to Russian military intelligence
- His sickly, pale appearance contrasts with his cold, calculating nature
- His complete lack of empathy makes him particularly dangerous as he has no moral qualms about his actions

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Dmitri Dvulikiy embodies the theme of deception central to the story. His dual identity as both Clayton's trusted assistant and Varick's "Number Two" operative makes him a complex antagonist whose betrayal cuts deeper than a mere outside threat. His technical expertise combined with his complete lack of empathy makes him particularly dangerous, as he has both the access and ability to weaponize Aivia's technology from within without any moral hesitation.
