# CHARACTER NAME CHANGES

## "Elon" to "Clayton Stanford"

In the brainstorming files, particularly uncat_17.md, the character now known as Clayton Stanford was previously referred to as "Elon". All references to "Elon" in the screenplay and character profiles have been updated to "Clayton Stanford" for consistency.

### Specific References Found:

1. "is this the homeless guy who is trying to warn elon?" - Referring to the beggar who tries to warn Clayton at the beginning
2. "beck jo - assistant to elon?" - Potential casting note for Clayton's assistant
3. "cameron kotecki - software, elon, or investor guy" - Potential casting note for Clayton
4. "but when he logs in under elon's alias, he discovers their signals active abroad" - Reference to Dex using Clayton's credentials
5. "at some point, investor will use the death of elon to make the case" - Reference to Varick using Clayton's death to further his agenda

### Other Potential Name Changes:

If any other alternative names for characters are found in the brainstorming files (such as "Eloy" or similar variations), they should also be standardized to maintain consistency in the screenplay.

## Character Naming Conventions

For clarity and consistency in the screenplay development process, all characters should be referred to by their final names in all documents:

- Clayton Stanford (CEO of Aivia)
- Dexton "Dex" Sharp (Lead Engineer)
- Varick (Number One/Main Villain)
- Mina Canario (Engineer who tried to sound the alarm)
