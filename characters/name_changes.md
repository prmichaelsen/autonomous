# CHARACTER NAME CHANGES

## "Elon" to "Clayton Stanford"

In the brainstorming files, particularly uncat_17.md, the character now known as Clayton Stanford was previously referred to as "Elon". All references to "Elon" in the screenplay and character profiles have been updated to "Clayton Stanford" for consistency.

### Specific References Found:

1. "is this the homeless guy who is trying to warn elon?" - Referring to the beggar who tries to warn Clayton at the beginning
2. "beck jo - assistant to elon?" - Potential casting note for Clayton's assistant
3. "cameron kotecki - software, elon, or investor guy" - Potential casting note for Clayton
4. "but when he logs in under elon's alias, he discovers their signals active abroad" - Reference to Dex using Clayton's credentials
5. "at some point, investor will use the death of elon to make the case" - Reference to Varick using Clayton's death to further his agenda

## "Ex-Viatech Security Engineer" to "Katalin Nouveau"

The character previously referred to as "Ex-Viatech Security Engineer" has been named "Katalin Nouveau". This character is a former security engineer at Viatech who discovered the backdoor in the autonomous vehicle system and teams up with Dex to expose the truth.

## "Detective Michael Russo" to "Detective Dillon Ravel"

The character previously known as "Detective Michael Russo" has been renamed to "Detective Dillon Ravel". This character is a police detective whose daughter Emma was killed by an Aivia Ghost autonomous vehicle, leading him to investigate the company.

## "Number Two" and "Dmitri Dvulikiy" Combined

The character previously referred to as "Number Two" has been confirmed to be Dmitri Dvulikiy. In the story, "Number Two" is Dmitri's position/alias within Varick's organization hierarchy, while he publicly serves as Clayton Stanford's right-hand person at Aivia. This dual identity reflects his two-faced nature (which is also the meaning of his surname "Dvulikiy" in Russian).

## Character Description Updates

### Dean Varick

Varick's character description has been updated to specify:
- Short in stature but commanding in presence
- No longer ex-military, but remains ex-DoD and ex-Defense Contractor
- Has ties high in Washington which gives him confidence
- Has piercing eyes and a steady gaze
- Is balding with hair ringing his head

### Dmitri Dvulikiy

Dmitri's character description has been updated to specify:
- Sickly, pale, white complexion
- Calculating eyes
- Thin frame
- Complete lack of empathy
- Serves as "Number Two" in Varick's organization

### Other Potential Name Changes:

If any other alternative names for characters are found in the brainstorming files (such as "Eloy" or similar variations), they should also be standardized to maintain consistency in the screenplay.

## Character Naming Conventions

For clarity and consistency in the screenplay development process, all characters should be referred to by their final names in all documents:

- Clayton Stanford (CEO of Aivia)
- Dexton "Dex" Sharp (Lead Engineer)
- Dean Varick (referred to as "Varick" in most dialogue and scenes)
- Dmitri Dvulikiy (Clayton's assistant, secretly Varick's "Number Two")
- Mina Canario (Engineer who tried to sound the alarm)
- Katalin Nouveau (Ex-Viatech Security Engineer)
- Detective Dillon Ravel (Police Detective investigating Aivia)
