# DMITRI DVULIKIY

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW

Dmitri Dvulikiy (meaning "two-faced" in Russian) is Clayton Stanford's right-hand person at Aivia, appearing to be a loyal sycophant who anticipates Clayton's needs and supports his vision. However, this is merely a facade. In reality, Dmitri is secretly working for Varick, programming the backdoor into Aivia's autonomous vehicles that allows for remote control and is personally responsible for orchestrating all the assassinations.

## CHARACTER TRAITS

- **Public Persona**: Deferential, efficient, detail-oriented, always agreeable to Clayton
- **Private Reality**: Calculating, ruthless, technically brilliant, morally compromised
- **Motivation**: Unknown initially (possibly financial gain, ideological alignment with military interests, or being blackmailed by Varick)
- **Technical Expertise**: Elite-level programming skills, particularly in AI systems and remote access protocols
- **Psychological Profile**: Likely sociopathic tendencies, able to compartmentalize actions, presents a completely different face to the world than his true self

## ROLE IN STORY

- Appears to be Clayton's most trusted advisor
- Secretly implemented the backdoor in Aivia's autonomous vehicle system
- Personally selects targets and executes assassinations via remote control
- Reports directly to Varick while maintaining cover as Clayton's loyal employee
- May be responsible for framing Dex when things start to unravel


## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

- Consider making Dmitri someone who initially believed in Clayton's vision but was corrupted/turned by Varick
- Potential for a scene where Dmitri is shown remotely executing an assassination, revealing his direct involvement
- Could have subtle hints throughout early scenes (unusual access to systems, unexplained absences, private calls)
- Might have personal connection to Dex that makes the betrayal more impactful
- His Russian background could be explored - perhaps he has ties to Russian military intelligence
- The name "Dvulikiy" (two-faced) could be something Dex discovers later, revealing the betrayal through the meaning of his name
