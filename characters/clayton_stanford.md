## BACKGROUND
Clayton Stanford founded Aivia with the vision of creating autonomous vehicles that would save lives and improve transportation. He secured funding that he believed came from climate initiatives but later discovers actually came from the military. He was unaware that his vehicles were being used for targeted assassinations, believing the incidents were simply accidents or edge cases.

## MOTIVATIONS
- Initially: Success, recognition, wealth, being seen as a visionary
- Later: Exposing the truth, warning the world about the dangers of his creation

## INTERNAL CONFLICTS
- Ambition vs. Ethics
- Pride vs. Truth
- Self-preservation vs. Responsibility

## FINAL THOUGHTS
Clayton Stanford represents the dangers of unchecked ambition and the moral responsibility of creators for their creations. His journey from arrogant CEO to whistleblower shows that redemption is possible, but often comes at a great cost. Despite his flaws, he ultimately tries to do the right thing, though Dex's final comment at his grave ("that's a crock of shit, coming from you") suggests his redemption may be incomplete or too late.
