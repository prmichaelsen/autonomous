# AUTONOMOUS FILM - MEMORY BANK

## STORY OVERVIEW

"Autonomous" is a techno-thriller that explores the dark side of autonomous vehicle technology. The story follows Clayton Stanford, the CEO of Aivia (a company that produces self-driving vehicles), and Dexton "Dex" Sharp, an engineer at the company. After an Aivia Ghost autonomous vehicle kills a "beggar" who was trying to warn Clayton about something, Clayton and Dex begin to uncover a conspiracy involving the military's use of the autonomous vehicles for targeted assassinations.

As Clayton digs deeper, he discovers that his company's funding comes from the military rather than climate initiatives as he believed, and that someone has been using his vehicles to kill people who threaten to expose the truth. Eventually, Clayton himself becomes a target when he starts asking too many questions.

The story culminates with Dex teaming up with an ex-Viatech security engineer who discovered a backdoor in the system. After Clayton and the engineer are killed, Dex uses the backdoor to defeat the true villain and destroy all the autonomous vehicles by driving them into bodies of water.
