## SCENE_01

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

On the sidewalk lies a man -- you'd be forgiven for mistaking him 
as a BEGGAR. Outside a busy complex nestled within the city, 
he waitst , for as long as possible, and as close as possible, 
every day by the headquarters office of the man who owned the 
company AIVIA.

He dons a blanket of newspapers. Prominent on one of the papers
is the sleek AIVIA GHOST self driving vehicle.

The BEGGAR mutters to himself, rehearsing.

                    BEGGAR
                    (inaudible)
          Clayton Stanford... Mr. Stanford... 
          I need to tell you something...

A BUSINESSMAN walks past, deliberately avoiding eye contact. 
The BEGGAR doesn't even notice -- his attention fixed solely 
on the building entrance.

Suddenly, the BEGGAR straightens up. His eyes widen.

CLAYTON STANFORD (40s) emerges. He has no sense of taste. His clothes are
expensive, but not well chosen. There's something off-putting about him -- 
a sickly pallor, beady eyes, and a thin-lipped smile that never reaches 
his eyes. He carries himself with the confidence of wealth and power, but 
in appearance and manner is rather revolting.

The BEGGAR's moment has arrived.

                    BEGGAR
                    (shouting)
          Clayton! Clayton Stanford!

CLAYTON pretends not to hear him, deliberately avoiding eye contact and 
quickening his pace.

                    BEGGAR
          I know you! I know you! You're 
          Clayton! Clayton Stanford! You have 
          to listen to me!

CLAYTON continues, committed to ignoring the disturbance. 
The BEGGAR reaches him and grabs at CLAYTON's sleeve,
like a man pleading for the future of humanity.

                    CLAYTON
          Get away from me!

                    CLAYTON (cont.)
          Vermin!

                    BEGGAR
          You have to know what you're doing!

CLAYTON forcefully breaks from the encounter and paces away.

                    CLAYTON
          Get lost!

CLAYTON begins to half jog. The BEGGAR continues shouting
and begins to chase after him.

                    BEGGAR
          You need to know the truth! I need 
          to tell you something! Clayton, stop, 
          listen! The world hangs in the balance.

CLAYTON keeps moving, but the BEGGAR's next words stop him cold.

                    BEGGAR
          You need to know! The truth about 
          Aivia!

CLAYTON freezes, halfway through a crosswalk. He slowly turns around, 
looking at the BEGGAR in the eyes for the first time.

                    CLAYTON (suspiciously)
          What do you know about Aivia?

The BEGGAR, halfway through the crosswalk, stops.

                    BEGGAR
          Come with me, and I'll tell you. I'll 
          tell you everything they have been 
          hiding from you.

The BEGGARS eyes are filled with a knowing look.
CLAYTON takes a moment to absorb the wretched vision of the man before 
him. Tattered clothes, matted hair, filthy hands, worn shoes.


                    CLAYTON
          You're a lunatic. There's nothing I 
          need to know from you.

                    BEGGAR
          I know about the accidents. I know 
          why they're--

Tires screech and the smoke and smell of burnt rubber suddenly fill the 
air. The vehicle screams to a halt —- but not before it slams directly into 
the BEGGAR.

He rag dolls, breaking his spine, his body swings like a pendulum, sending 
his head careening into the asphalt. Cracking open his skull. 
Blood rushes onto the pavement -- an ugly scene.

Clayton freezes in the moment. His eyes absorb the scene. Perhaps for a 
moment, he felt a fleeting moment of empathy. Of guilt. He processed the 
BEGGAR's words. "Accidents", he thinks. "What does he know?"

The shock begins to subside from his face. His eyes turn from horror to fear.

The picture of the reality settles into his mind.

                    CLAYTON
                    (to himself)
          I can't be here.

                    BYSTANDER (O.S.)
          Oh my god! Help him!

Panicked, shaking to his core, he briskly abouts face, his nervous system 
screaming to run, run now.

                    CLAYTON
                    (to himself)
          I can't be seen.

He begins to dart away, holding his suite jacket over his head.

First he paces quickly, then he begins to run, then he is sprinting.

Scenes of the city rush by him and blur together as he runs harder and harder, 
with no particular destination.

His mind is fixed on only one thought, "I can't be here. I can't be seen here. 
This is not good. This can't get out"

Sirens and lights begin to flood his senses.

EMTs and police vehicles fly past him.

He finally stops and collects himself.

He breaths deeply.

He picks up the phone and dials.

The line on the other end answers, but doesn't speak.

                    CLAYTON
          I need you to make something disappear for me.

The camera cuts back to the scene of the accident.

Sirens are flashing, casting shadows and blue and red silhouettes of the 
figures standing over the body of the man before him.

He chokes, gurgles blood, holding onto his last breaths.

His last words to the bystander who rushed to him first:

                    BEGGAR
          Stop… Viatech… Stop… Aivia...

The life finally leaves his eyes as the camera pans out from the scene.
The vehicle that hit him is revealed.  Decals on the car are clearly visible.
Dented, and rich with blood. "AIVIA GHOST" reads the decals.

Beneath the words, read a slogan: "THE FUTURE DRIVES ITSELF"

The shot pans outward to a birds eye view.

## SCENE_01B

INT. VIATECH HEADQUARTERS - MID-DAY

CLAYTON rushes into the office, past reception and through rows of employees 
frantically typing or on calls.

Some personnel, potentially a high ranking member of the company, chases 
down CLAYTON.

                    HIGH-RANKING EXECUTIVE
          Clayton!

He begins to speak, but CLAYTON's ears are ringing, all he hears is that 
ringing, his vision is blurry and out of focus. He strides through the 
office, walking past employee after employee rising from their desk to 
get his attention.

Finally he reaches a door and opens it.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

His private office, corner office, massive, luxury.

He slams it shut behind him and breathes a deep, nervous sigh of relief.

He looks up.

A FIGURE (VARICK) stands by the window, not facing CLAYTON.

                    FIGURE
          Close the blinds.

## SCENE_01C

INT. VIATECH HEADQUARTERS - OUTSIDE CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MID-DAY

The blinds of the office close shut.

The chaos, rabble, and noise of the office fills the scene.  One engineer 
sits at his desk: DEXTON SHARP. His eyes are glued to his screen.
His hand covers half his face. He watches on in abject horror, terror, 
and guilt as the scene flashes across his monitor.

Through his headphones we hear:

                    REPORTER (V.O.)
          Reporting at the scene of a horrific 
          accident here at the intersection of 
          5th Ave and 7th St in Downtown, as a 
          man was hit by one of Viatech's 'Aivia 
          Ghosts', a self driving vehicle that 
          drivers have come to know as a safer, 
          faster, and more convenient alternative 
          to other modes of transportation. This 
          accident is the first of its kind, 
          after Aivia Ghost's have been on the 
          road for at least 14 months since it's 
          initial public launch. The accident 
          comes mere days before Viatech's 
          unveiling of the 'Aivia Mammoth', a 
          self driving semi-truck that promises 
          to revolutionize the supply chain 
          industry. Questions will arise as to 
          how this happened, how safe the Aivia 
          Ghost truly is, and who—is accountable. 
          Signing off for Channel 10 news...

CU DEX's face, framed from shoulders upwards, his dress shirt is steeped 
in sweat, his hands nervously tap his desk. The camera pans closer and 
closer to his flustered face, which is filled with a dreadful fear. His 
heart is pulsing, and we hear it getting louder and louder as the reporting 
continues and as we continue to zoom closer into a XCU of his eyes. The 
world around him grows in distance in a Hitchcock shot. White noise and 
ringing slowly overtake the reporting, as DEX wipes sweat from his face.

                    CLAYTON (O.S.)
          Dex.

DEX wheels his head around in a panic. His eyes meet CLAYTON's.

                    CLAYTON
          We need to talk.

## SCENE_02

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

The blinds are shut.

Silence pierces the stiff air.

Clayton is the first to speak.

                    CLAYTON
          Well?

                    DEX
          Sir, this is... this is just 
          impossible... this couldn't happen.

                    CLAYTON
          Evidently it is possible, Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          A man is splattered on the pavement 
          and headlines are splattered across 
          every major news site on the planet!

He pauses.

                    CLAYTON
                    (yelling)
          International! This is international 
          news! Do you know what this does to 
          our image? Our success?

                    DEX
          I don't--

                    CLAYTON
          You're lucky you didn't kill a 
          customer! FAITH is the key component 
          of our business. TRUST and SAFETY.

                    CLAYTON
          It only works if people BELIEVE it 
          is safe!

                    DEX
          I--

                    CLAYTON
          You're LUCKY the man who died was a 
          nobody. No one will miss him. No 
          lawsuits from a grieving family.

                    CLAYTON
          But we're still going to have the 
          DOJ up our ass, the FCC, the DOT, 
          all are going to be coming for blood, 
          you understand? To shut this company 
          down. Everything that I have built, 
          everything I have done, could go 
          down in flames! My blood! My sweat! 
          My credibility. My entire life.

                    CLAYTON
          Speak.

                    DEX
          I will look into it, sir. But I'm 
          telling you, this couldn't have been 
          our tech. I'm certain. Maybe if 
          something in QC went wrong--that's 
          the only failure point, QC. Human 
          error. A machine did not make this 
          mistake on its own. The tech is safe.

                    CLAYTON
          Listen carefully.

                    CLAYTON
          You're at my mercy right now. I 
          could have you disappear for this. 
          By not killing you right now, I'm 
          showing you mercy. I am showing you 
          my grace.

                    CLAYTON
          Are you grateful for my grace?

                    DEX
          Sir, I--

CLAYTON slams the desk and shouts at full volume, almost shrieking, almost 
like a frightened child, trying to project power, but deep in a tantrum. 
More begging than anything else, a self-assured man in the throes of 
instability.

                    CLAYTON
          TELL ME, YOU ARE GRATEFUL FOR MY 
          MERCY!

                    DEX
                    (quietly)
          I'm grateful...

                    CLAYTON
          For?

                    DEX
          Your mercy...

                    CLAYTON
          The man who died... who was he?

                    DEX
          No one. Which is who you will be if 
          you do not give me answers: how did 
          this happen?

                    DEX
          It can't. We have 10 million miles 
          driven with no incident, testing is 
          sound, QA left nothing unturned, 
          every edge case, every crash scenario, 
          we simulated everything. Our sensors 
          have 99.9 repeating to the 20th 
          decimal place precision. I can tell 
          you it was not a computer vision 
          issue. This was not an issue with 
          the technology, something happened 
          here.

                    CLAYTON
          Obviously there was an edge case, 
          Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          99.9 whatever percent is not 100.

                    CLAYTON
          That's how you failed.

                    DEX
          This technology has always had a 
          non-zero chance of failure, however 
          small, that non-zero chance is always 
          there. Never have I reported this 
          technology as 100% safe. I want that 
          to be clear. But 99.9 repeating to 
          the 20th decimal place is as good as 
          100%, six sigma is the standard, 
          that's 99.99966. But if you map our 
          data on a bell curve that includes 
          our success cases the sigma value is 
          theoretically infinite.

                    CLAYTON
          There's a non-zero chance you will 
          spend the rest of your life in a 
          federal prison, Dex.

                    CLAYTON
          What's the sigma on that?

                    CLAYTON
          How would you map that on a bell 
          curve?

dEX breathes a deep breath.

                    DEX
          Listen, I want us to take a clearer 
          view of the situation. You need to 
          think about this objectively. I'm 
          emotional, you're emotional, this is 
          not a time to be emotional. It's time 
          to account for all the possible ways 
          this scenario could play out.

                    DEX
          There's no legal precedent for this. 
          It could be a fine, they could go 
          after the engineering team, they 
          might go after the one who signed 
          off, sir.

                    CLAYTON
          If you have any ounce of 
          self-preservation, Dex, you'll find 
          out what went wrong, and who is 
          responsible. Right now it's on your 
          head unless you can prove that it's 
          not your fault. When they subpoena 
          the company, you're the one who will 
          be answering questions, not me.

                    CLAYTON
          I'm the face of this company, I'm 
          the visionary behind this company, 
          I'm an advocate for the future of 
          humanity, but engineering? That's on 
          you.

                    CLAYTON
          This company can survive without you, 
          it wouldn't exist without me.

                    CLAYTON
          Someone needs to be the face of this 
          failure.

                    CLAYTON
          And if you don't give me a definitive 
          answer of who or what was responsible 
          in the next 48 hours, then it's going 
          to be you.

Dex exits the office.

Dex steps out to face the entire team standing gathered outside Clayton's door.

Pause.

          What did he say?

                    DEX
          He's a little upset.

Beat.

                    DEX
          How do you feel about sleeping in 
          the office tonight?

                    ENGINEER #2
          Judging by what I heard from that 
          conversation, I don't think any of 
          us are sleeping tonight.

                    DEX
          Yeah, I probably couldn't sleep if 
          I wanted to.

                    DEX
          Unless you're interested in taking 
          the fall for me?

          Well, let's just say it's a good 
          thing he's coming after you, and not 
          me.

                    DEX
          And why's that?

                    ENGINEER #2
          Because I sure as fuck don't want to 
          be in the hotseat.

## SCENE_2B

INT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - TECHNICAL LAB - NIGHT

Dex sits alone in the dimly lit lab, surrounded by multiple screens. The 
only light comes from the monitors, casting a blue glow on his exhausted 
face. Empty coffee cups litter the desk.

He's reviewing data logs from the accident, scrolling through lines of 
code and vehicle telemetry.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: Vehicle diagnostic data showing normal operations, then 
a sudden override command followed by acceleration.

                    DEX
                    (to himself)
          This doesn't make sense...

He pulls up another screen showing a database of all Aivia test vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: A spreadsheet with hundreds of entries. Many have 
location data, but over 100 entries show "LOCATION DATA UNAVAILABLE" or 
"ACCESS RESTRICTED."

Dex narrows his eyes, types rapidly.

                    DEX
          Computer, show me all vehicles with 
          restricted location data for the past 
          six months.

The computer processes. A new screen appears showing a timeline with 
clusters of vehicles going dark at specific dates.

Dex leans forward, puzzled.

                    DEX
          That's weird... over a hundred vehicles 
          unaccounted for.

He tries another command.

          vehicles.

CLOSE ON SCREEN: "ACCESS DENIED - SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED"

                    DEX
          What the hell?

He quickly downloads the vehicle inventory data to a secure drive, looking 
nervously over his shoulder.

The lab door OPENS. Dex quickly switches screens. A SECURITY GUARD peers in.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Mr. Sharp? Still here? Building's 
          closing down for the night.

                    DEX
                    (casual)
          Just finishing up. Clayton wants this 
          analysis by morning.

The guard nods, leaves. Dex waits until the footsteps fade, then ejects 
the drive and pockets it.

He pulls out his phone, hesitates, then dials.

                    DEX
          Clayton? We need to talk. There's 
          something you need to see.

## SCENE_03A

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Clayton sits behind his desk, reviewing the data Dex has presented. His 
expression darkens with each slide.

                    CLAYTON
                    (seething)
          I want to congratulate you on finding me nothing.

                    DEX
          Over a hundred of them, Clayton. With 
          restricted access that even I can't get into. 
          Why would our own vehicles be classified?

Clayton SLAMS his fist on the desk, stands abruptly.

                    CLAYTON
                    (seething)
          Do you have ANY idea what you're implying?
          That MY company is hiding something?

                    DEX
                    (exhausted but determined)
          I'm just showing you what I found, Clayton.
          I can't explain it, but something's not right.

Clayton walks around the desk, gets in Dex's face.

                    CLAYTON
          I gave you 48 hours. I was very clear about 
          what would happen if you didn't deliver.

He taps his watch.

                    CLAYTON
          Time's up, Dex.

                    DEX
          For God's sake, Clayton! I'm trying to protect 
          the company! Don't you want to know why our 
          own vehicles are being hidden from us?

Clayton's expression shifts from anger to cold calculation. He moves toward the window.

Blue and red lights begin to flash through the glass, illuminating the room in pulses.

                    CLAYTON
          Time's up, Dex.

Dex stares at him, realization dawning as the police lights fill the room.

The office door BURSTS open. Two FBI AGENTS in suits enter, followed by 
more agents. Everything seems to slow down for Dex.

SLOW MOTION: The agents approach, their movements fluid yet deliberate. 
Sound becomes muffled, distant. One agent pulls out handcuffs that glint 
in the office light.

Dex watches, almost detached, as they grab his arms. The cold metal of 
handcuffs clicks around his wrists.

                    CLAYTON
          You know what happens now, Dex? You disappear. 
          You'll spend the rest of your life in a cell. 
          No one will remember your name. Your family 
          will never know what happened to you. Just 
          another brilliant mind... gone.

Dex struggles against the agents.

                    DEX
          I didn't do this! You know I didn't do this!

Clayton's expression hardens, his voice dropping to a whisper.

                    CLAYTON
          No, Dex. You did.

EXT. AIVIA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

The glass doors of the building open. Dex is led out in handcuffs by the 
FBI agents. A CROWD has gathered - PROTESTERS with signs reading "KILLER 
CARS" and "AI KILLS," NEWS CREWS with cameras rolling, REPORTERS shouting 
questions.

CAMERA FLASHES blind Dex momentarily. Microphones are thrust in his face.

Dex is pushed toward a waiting FBI vehicle. Through the crowd, he spots 
Clayton watching from the building entrance, flanked by PR PEOPLE.

Dex's face is a mask of somber realizations. He makes direct eye contact 
with Clayton across the crowd - a silent, powerful accusation. Clayton 
looks away first.

The FBI agents shove Dex into the back of the vehicle. As the door closes, 
we see Dex's expression: resolute, somber, calculating.

INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Clayton watches from his window as the FBI car drives away. His confident 
facade cracks slightly. He is thinking to himself, but says nothing. The seed of
doubt has been planted in his mind. He thinks for a long time.

Clayton turns to DMITRI DVULIKIY, his right-hand man who has been standing 
silently in the corner.

                    CLAYTON
                    (turning to Dmitri)
          What was Dex's clearance level?

                    DMITRI
          Secret.

                    CLAYTON
          And what's yours?

                    DMITRI
          Top secret, sir.

                    CLAYTON
          I need you to look into something for me.

DMITRI enters the building.

                    REPORTER #1
          Mr. Stanford, what can you tell us about 
          the accusations against Dexton Sharp?

                    CLAYTON
          Aivia has always prioritized safety and 
          transparency. When we discovered potential 
          tampering with our systems, we immediately 
          contacted authorities.

                    REPORTER #2
          Is it true that Mr. Sharp was responsible 
          for the accident that killed a child?

                    CLAYTON
          I can't comment on an ongoing investigation, 
          but I can assure you that Aivia's autonomous 
          vehicles remain the safest in the industry.

Clayton's phone RINGS. He checks it, his expression shifting subtly.

                    CLAYTON
          I apologize, but I need to take this. My team 
          will provide you with our official statement.

He steps away from the reporters, moving toward a sleek black car waiting 
at the curb. As he opens the door, we see his face harden with determination.

                    CLAYTON
                    (into phone)
          I'm on my way.

DMITRI, watching from the building steps, steps back into 
the shadows and watches CLAYTON leave.

## SCENE_03B

INT. FBI DETENTION CENTER - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT

Dex, handcuffed, is being processed for transfer. An FBI AGENT silently 
hands Dex over to DETECTIVE RUSSO (40s, crew cut, weathered face, rigid 
posture). Russo's eyes are hard, his jaw clenched tight as he stares at Dex.

Dex maintains his stoic demeanor as Russo roughly takes his arm and leads 
him out. Not a word is spoken.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Dex sits in the back, separated by a cage. Russo drives in complete silence, 
eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, never looking back. The tension is palpable.

They pass a roadside memorial with flowers and a child's teddy bear. 
Russo's knuckles whiten on the steering wheel.

The city lights fade behind them as Russo takes an exit, then another. 
The roads become narrower, less traveled. Dex shifts uncomfortably but 
remains silent.

Russo drives onto a dirt road. The cruiser bounces over ruts and potholes. 
He begins to speak, his voice quiet at first, eyes fixed straight ahead, 
never looking back at Dex.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          Her name was Emma. Eight years old.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          She loved butterflies. Had this collection 
          of them on her wall. Drew them everywhere.

His voice grows softer, more distant. Tears begin to well in his eyes, 
but his gaze remains locked on the road ahead.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          She wanted to be a scientist. Study 
          insects. So smart. So damn smart.

He wipes at his eyes with one hand, still driving.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          Every night, she'd tell me about some 
          new fact she learned. Did you know 
          butterflies taste with their feet? 
          She told me that.

The car slows as they reach a clearing in the woods. Russo stops the car, 
turns off the engine. His shoulders begin to shake.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          She was in our front yard. Playing. 
          There was this butterfly... blue one. 
          She... she chased it into the street.

His voice breaks. Tears streaming down his face.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          I saw it happen. She ran into the street... 
          right in front of the car. It should have 
          stopped. It should have seen her. Why didn't
          it see her?

He swallows hard.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          I ran to her. Held her in my arms. So 
          small. So... broken.

His knuckles turn white on the steering wheel.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
                    (whispers to himself)
          She just loved butterflies.

Suddenly, he makes a hard turn off the road. The cruiser lurches as it 
leaves the pavement, bouncing violently over rough terrain. Dex is thrown 
against the cage as they crash through underbrush.

The car finally stops in a small clearing. Russo gets out, silently walks 
to the trunk. Dex watches through the rear window.

Russo yanks open the back door and drags Dex out, throwing him to the ground.
In one fluid motion, he draws his gun and grabs Dex by the head, pressing
the barrel against his temple.

                    DEX
          Officer, please—

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
                    (exploding)
          SHUT UP!

Russo's hand trembles as he presses the gun harder against Dex's head.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          YOU KILLED MY DAUGHTER!

                    DEX
                    (terrified)
          I didn't—I swear—

Russo cocks the hammer.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          SAY IT! SAY YOU KILLED HER!

                    DEX
          Please... I didn't do this. There's more 
          this... there's... there's more...

Russo's finger tightens on the trigger. A moment of terrible tension.

Then, slowly, Russo lowers the gun. Trembling, he stumbles back against 
his vehicle, slides to the ground, and begins silently sobbing, his face 
in his hands.

After a long silence, he looks up at Dex, his voice gentle.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          I believe you. I wanted to believe you. 
          But I had to be sure.

A long pause as they stare at each other.

                    DETECTIVE RUSSO
          This isn't the first time these things 
          have killed someone.
